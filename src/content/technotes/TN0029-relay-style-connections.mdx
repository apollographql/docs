[Relay](https://relay.dev) is an opinionated GraphQL client, and its associated [Connections specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm) defines a pattern for expressing one-to-many relationships in a GraphQL schema:

```graphql
query MyPosts($cursor: String) {
  viewer {
    posts(first: 5, after: $cursor) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          content
        }
        cursor
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<ExpansionPanel title="View the GraphQL schema for the above operation">

```graphql
type Query {
  viewer: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  posts(first: Int, after: String, last: Int, before: String): PostConnection!
}

"""
This wrapper type contains the list of "edges" and
pagination metadata.
"""
type PostConnection {
  edges: [PostEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

"""
The "edge" wrapper contains metadata about the item in the
list. By default it's just a cursor indicating the position
of the item in the list, but additional metadata is allowed.
"""
type PostEdge {
  """
  The "node" is the actual item in the list.
  """
  node: Post
  cursor: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
}

"""
The specification includes the pagination metadata
in a common type.
"""
type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

It's worth noting that Facebook designed the Connections specification for their Newsfeed feature with these features in mind:

- It uses cursor-based pagination.
- It supports paging backward (with the `before` cursor) and forward (with the `after` cursor).
- Each item in the list has a cursor you can use to jump to a specific page in the middle of the list.

These features might not perfectly meet your requirements or the capabilities of your downstream data sources.

## Do I have to use Relay-style connections?

No, unless you're using the Relay client. But its popularity outside of the Relay ecosystem is worth taking advantage of:

- Many developers are familiar with the connection pattern.
- It encapsulates several schema design best practices.
- It's designed to be future-proof and support gradual evolution of your GraphQL schema.

## Do I even need a wrapper type for my lists?

Consider the ["Zero, One, Infinity" rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_one_infinity_rule) — can you definitively assert that your list will never require pagination or other metadata about the relationship?

Using a wrapper type for lists provides the following benefits:

- **Avoid breaking changes.** You can initially return a wrapper type that _doesn't_ use pagination, and then add pagination later without breaking existing clients. If you return a list directly, you _can't_ add pagination metadata later.
- **Represent entity relationships.** The `Connection` and `Edge` wrapper types support fields that model attributes _of the relationship between entities_ that don't belong in the entities themselves.

    Consider this example of a many-to-many relationship between `Business` and `Customer`:

   ```graphql
   type Business {
     id: ID
     customers: CustomerConnection
   }

   type CustomerConnection {
     edges: [CustomerEdge]
     total: Int
   }

   type CustomerEdge {
     node: Customer
     type: CustomerType #highlight-line
   }

   enum CustomerType {
     IN_STORE
     ONLINE
     MULTI_CHANNEL
   }

   type Customer {
     id: ID
     shopsAt: BusinessConnection # --snip --
   }
   ```

   A specific `Customer` might shop at one business `IN_STORE` and another `ONLINE`. The `type` is an attribute of the _relationship_, not the business or customer itself. Without wrapper types, you don't have a place to put this data.

## Do I have to implement the entire connection specification?

No, you can use a subset of the specification. You can implement additional parts over time to reach full compliance with the specification (if necessary).

If your downstream data sources don't support paging backward, you limit your implementation to forward pagination:

<ExpansionPanel title="An example with only forward pagination">

```graphql
query MyPosts($cursor: String) {
  viewer {
    posts(first: 5, after: $cursor) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
          content
        }
        cursor
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
type Query {
  viewer: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  posts(first: Int, after: String): PostConnection!
}

type PostConnection {
  edges: [PostEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type PostEdge {
  node: Post
  cursor: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  endCursor: String
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

If your downstream data sources don't support per-node cursors, you can drop the `edges` field and use `nodes`:

<ExpansionPanel title="An example without edges">

```graphql
query MyPosts($cursor: String) {
  viewer {
    posts(first: 5, after: $cursor) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        content
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
type Query {
  viewer: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  posts(first: Int, after: String, last: Int, before: String): PostConnection!
}

type PostConnection {
  nodes: [Post!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}

type PostEdge {
  node: Post
  cursor: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
}

type PageInfo {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

## Are there other ways to design my schema for pagination?

Yes. If your requirements or downstream capabilities don't fit the Relay-style connections spec, we recommend using a visibly different set of conventions so that it's clear to graph consumers that they shouldn't expect to use Relay connection patterns.

Here's an example of pagination that uses page offsets and supports a UI for jumping to a specific page:

<ExpansionPanel title="An alternative to Relay-style connections">

```graphql
query MyPosts($page: Int) {
  viewer {
    posts(page: $page) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        content
      }
      totalPages
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
type Query {
  viewer: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  posts(page: Int): PostsPaginated!
}

"""
This wrapper type uses a different suffix to distinguish
it from Relay-style connection wrappers.
"""
type PostsPaginated {
  """
  Using `nodes` avoids the redundant
  `{ posts { posts { id } } }` selection set.
  """
  nodes: [Post!]!

  """
  Adding pagination metadata directly to the
  wrapper type works well.
  """
  totalPages: Int!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
}
```

## Can I use Relay-style connections with Apollo Federation?

Yes! You define the schema and resolvers for the connection relationship within a single subgraph, so federation has almost no ramifications on the pattern.

The one exception is the `PageInfo` type, which commonly has a consistent definition for all connections. You must mark this type's definition as `@shareable` to define it in multiple subgraphs:

```graphql
type PageInfo @shareable {
  hasNextPage: Boolean!
  hasPreviousPage: Boolean!
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
```
