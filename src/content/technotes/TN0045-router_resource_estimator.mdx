import RouterResourceEstimator from '../../components/TechNotes/RouterResourceEstimator';

The **router resource estimator** estimates the system resources you need to allocate for the Apollo Router to run production traffic. The resource estimator can help you get a _starting baseline_ that you can then iterate on.

To use the estimator:

1. Enter your expected average **request rate (RPS)** and **peak request rate (RPS)**.
2. Adjust the other parameters to match your expected production load.
   - When selecting the number of instances, select fewer for efficiency, more for safety.
3. Be sure to **test and iterate**.
