The following tool is provided to help estimate what system resources you will need to allocate for Apollo Router running your production traffic. It will help you get a starting baseline that you can then tweak and iterate on.

To use this estimator, enter in your expected average `Request Rate per Second` and `Peak Request Rate per Second`. Then tweak the other parameters to match your expected production load. **Make sure to test and iterate.**
