import RouterResourceEstimator from "../../components/TechNotes/RouterResourceEstimator";

The **router resource estimator** estimates the system resources you need to allocate for the Apollo Router to run production traffic. The resource estimator can help you get a _starting baseline_ that you can then iterate on.

## Usage

To use the estimator:

1. Enter your estimated **request rate per second** and **peak request rate per second**.
2. Adjust the other parameters to match your estimated production load.
   - When selecting the **number of instances**, select fewer for efficiency, more for safety.
3. Be sure to **test and iterate**.
