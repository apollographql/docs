This would be some intro text talking about what this is for...

How to use this estimator:

1. Enter average request rate and peak request rate
2. Pick an appropriate number of instances (fewer for efficiency, more for safety)
3. Test and iterate!

import RouterResourceEstimator from "../../components/TechNotes/RouterResourceEstimator";

<RouterResourceEstimator />
