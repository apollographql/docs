With [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview/), your federated supergraph's gateway or router automatically fetches its composed supergraph schema from Apollo. If your supergraph _doesn't_ use managed federation, you need to compose the supergraph schema and provide it to your gateway via another mechanism. This article describes options and considerations for that process.

## Composing the supergraph schema

Options for composing your supergraph schema _besides_ managed federation are described below.

### Build status webhook

This approach uses the [build status webhook](/studio/build-status-notification) to trigger redeployment of a gateway or router by updating on successful builds with a composed supergraph schema provided by Apollo Studio. The payload of the webhook contains a URL to download the composed schema. 

The advantage of this approach is that you have a confirmed build that composes successfully. However, the webhook notification is sent _before_ operation checks are run against your historical operation data. This means you should [run schema checks with Rover as part of your CI/CD pipeline](/rover/commands/subgraphs/#checking-subgraph-schema-changes).

### Local composition

**If you're using [Contracts](/studio/contracts/)**, local composition cannot be used. Instead, use the [build status webhook](#build-status-webhook) as described above.

You can use the [Rover CLI](/rover/) to compose your supergraph schema as part of your CI/CD pipeline. You then provide this schema directly to your gateway or router.

The process for setting this up can vary depending on your CI tooling, but you always use `rover supergraph compose` to build the supergraph schema from a configuration file. Additionally, you need to:

- Keep track of all your subgraphs and their routing URLs
- Be able to trigger the build on any new updates to any subgraphs

You can use the [build status webhook](/studio/build-status-notification) to track this information if you want to use Apollo Studio but prefer performing composition locally.

To run the `rover supergraph compose` command, you need access to each subgraph's schema SDL. There are a few ways to do this: 

- Use the `rover subgraph introspect` command to fetch subgraph schemas via introspection
- Fetch subgraph schemas from a version control service, such as Github or Gitlab

As described in the [Build status webhook section](#build-status-webhook), make sure to use [schema checks in your CI/CD pipeline](/rover/commands/subgraphs/#checking-subgraph-schema-changes) or during build time to verify that any changes won't break existing clients. 

For more information on how to accomplish this, see: 

- [The `rover supergraph compose` command](/rover/commands/supergraphs#supergraph-compose)
- [The federation quickstart](/federation/quickstart/local-composition)

## Providing a composed supergraph schema

After you compose your supergraph schema, there are a few different ways to provide that file to your gateway or router:

### Hot reloading

**If you're using the Apollo Router,** you can enable hot reloading by passing the `--hr` option to the `router` executable. No other configuration is required.

**If you're using the `@apollo/gateway` library,** you can enable hot reloading by setting up a basic watcher.

For example, if you're using Docker, you can pass the supergraph schema file as a mounted volume. In the following example, the supergraph schema is mounted to `/etc/config/supergraph.graphql`:

```Dockerfile
version: '3'
services:
  apollo-gateway:
    container_name: apollo-gateway
    build: ./gateway
    volumes:
      - ./supergraph.graphql:/etc/config/supergraph.graphql
    ports:
```

After you make the schema file available to your gateway instances, pass a function to the `supergraphSdl` option of your `ApolloGateway` constructor that enables the gateway to hot reload the schema. The example function below uses the `chokidar` library to watch for file updates:

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require('@apollo/server');
const { startStandaloneServer } = require('@apollo/server/standalone');
const { ApolloGateway } = require('@apollo/gateway');
const { readFile } = require('fs/promises');
const chokidar = require('chokidar');
const supergraphSdlLocation = '/etc/config/supergraph.graphql';

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  async supergraphSdl({ update, healthCheck }) {
    const watcher = chokidar.watch(supergraphSdlLocation);
    watcher.on('change', async ()=>{
      try {
          const updatedSupergraph = await readFile(supergraphSdlLocation, 'utf-8');
          // optional health check update to ensure our services are responsive
          await healthCheck(updatedSupergraph);
          // update the supergraph schema
          update(updatedSupergraph);
        } catch (e) {
          // handle errors that occur during health check or while updating the supergraph schema
          console.error(e);
        }
    });
    return {
      supergraphSdl: await readFile(supergraphSdlLocation, 'utf-8'),
      async cleanup() {
        await watcher.close();
      }
    }
  },
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
});

const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
```

In the code above, the `ApolloGateway` is passed a `supergaphSdl` property. This property can be a string (for a supergraph schema that _never_ changes during runtime), or it can be a function that enables updating the schema during runtime as shown.  

For more information on this approach, [see the Apollo Gateway docs](/federation/gateway/#updating-the-supergraph-schema).

### Custom `SupergraphManager`

If you have complex logic that's be better suited to its own class (for example, listening to an AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic), you can create a custom implementation of the `SupergraphManager` class to pass to the `supergraphSdl` option.

This option provides the most customizability, but it also requires writing additional code. For an example, [see the Uplink implementation of `SupergraphManager`](https://github.com/apollographql/federation/blob/main/gateway-js/src/supergraphManagers/UplinkSupergraphManager/index.ts). 

If we were to write the same file watcher function as above as a `SupergraphManager`, it would look like: 

```ts
import { SupergraphManager } from '@apollo/gateway';
import { SupergraphSdlHookOptions } from '@apollo/gateway/dist/config';
import * as chokidar from 'chokidar';
import {readFile} from 'fs/promises';

export class FileWatcherManager implements SupergraphManager {
    private filename: string; 

    constructor({
        filename,
    }:{
        filename: string
    }){
        this.filename = filename
    }
    
    public async initialize({ update, healthCheck }: SupergraphSdlHookOptions) {
        let watcher = chokidar.watch(this.filename)

        watcher.on('change', async ()=>{
            try {
                const updatedSupergraph = await readFile(this.filename, 'utf-8');
                // optional health check update to ensure our services are responsive
                await healthCheck(updatedSupergraph);
                // update the supergraph schema
                update(updatedSupergraph);
            } catch (e) {
                // handle errors that occur during health check or while updating the supergraph schema
                console.error(e);
            }
        });
        
        return {
            supergraphSdl: await readFile(this.filename, 'utf-8'),
            cleanup: async () => {
                await watcher.close()
            },
          };
    }   
}
```

To use your custom `SupergraphManager`, you instantiate it and pass it as the `sueprgraphSdl` property, like so:

```ts
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl: new FileWatcherManager({filename: './supergraph.graphql'})
})
```

### Restart the gateway/router (not recommended)

The most straightforward option for updating your supergraph schema is to restart all of your gateway or router instances. If you pass your supergraph schema file to these instances via a build process (such as a Docker image), you can redeploy for your changes to take effect.

**This method is _not_ recommended,** because the restart can potentially cause downtime for your supergraph. The methods described above can update your supergraph schema _without_ requiring redeployment.

## Local development with `IntrospectAndCompose`

If you're using `@apollo/gateway` locally and are able to query your subgraphs ([_not_ through the public internet](/enterprise-guide/graph-security/#only-allow-the-gateway-to-query-subgraphs-directly)), you can use [`IntrospectAndCompose`](/federation/api/apollo-gateway/#class-introspectandcompose).

```javascript
const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl: new IntrospectAndCompose({
    subgraphs: [
      { name: 'products', url: 'https://products-service.dev/graphql' },
      { name: 'reviews', url: 'https://reviews-service.dev/graphql' },
    ],
  }),
});
```

This uses the [`_service` field](/federation/subgraph-spec#enhanced-introspection-with-query_service) to fetch the schema information directly from a running subgraph instead of fetching from Studio. If you're using [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/overview/), this field is not needed.
