## Response types for mutations

> See also [Structuring mutation responses](/apollo-server/schema/schema#structuring-mutation-responses).

This response type pattern is useful for mutations because they can result in many valid failure states (such as attempting to delete an object that doesn't exist).

For example, let's say we have an e-commerce graph. When executing a `checkout` mutation, it's valid for that mutation to fail if a purchased item is out of stock or the buyer has insufficient funds.

If we define a set of `ErrorResponse` types in our schema, front-end developers can provide customized experiences based on the type of failure that occurred:

```graphql
interface MutationResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
}

type CheckoutSuccess implements MutationResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  cart: [Product!]!
  invoice: Invoice!
}

interface ErrorResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  message: String!
}

type CheckoutError implements ErrorResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  message: String!
}

union CheckoutResponse = CheckoutSuccess | CheckoutError

type Mutation {
  checkout(cart: ID!): CheckoutResponse!
}
```


## Response types for queries

Let's say we have a basic GraphQL API that defines the following `Query` type:

```graphql
type Query {
  users: [User!]!
}
```

This `Query.users` field makes intuitive sense: if you query it, you get back a list of `User` objects. _However_, this return type doesn't provide any insight into the result:

* If the list is empty, is that because there are zero users, or did an error occur?
* Even if the list is populated, did the API return _all_ users or just a subset?
* Are there multiple pages of results?

To answer questions like these, it may be helpful for top-level fields of `Query` to return "wrapper" objects that can include both the operation result _and_ metadata about the operation's execution. Some examples of where this is specifically helpful is in cases where you need to [paginate your results](/technotes/TN0027-demand-oriented-schema-design/#a-brief-sidebar-on-pagination-conventions) or implement [Relay-style connections](/technotes/TN0029-relay-style-connections/).

### Example: `UsersResponse`

The following example defines a `UsersResponse` type for our `Query.users` field:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}

type UsersResponse {
  offset: Int!
  perPage: Int!
  totalResults: Int!
  data: [User!]!
}

type Query {
  users(perPage: Int = 10, offset: Int = 0): UsersResponse!
}
```

With this change, a client's query can specify how many results per page, what page to start on, and understand the total number of results that can be paginated:

```graphql
query FetchUsers {
  users(perPage: 20, offset: 0) {
    totalResults
    data {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```
