Let's say we have a basic GraphQL API that defines the following `Query` type:

```graphql
type Query {
  users: [User!]!
}
```

This `Query.users` field makes intuitive sense: if you query it, you get back a list of `User` objects. _However_, this return type doesn't provide any insight into the result:

* If the list is empty, is that because there are zero users, or did an error occur?
* Even if the list is populated, did the API return _all_ users or just a subset?

To answer questions like these, it's helpful for top-level fields of `Query` and `Mutation` to return "wrapper" objects that can include both the operation result _and_ metadata about the operation's execution.

## Example: `UsersResponse`

The following example defines a `UsersResponse` type for our `Query.users` field:

```graphql
enum ResponseStatus {
  SUCCESS
  FAILURE
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}

type UsersResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  total: Int!
  users: [User!]!
}

type Query {
  users: UsersResponse!
}
```

With this change, a client's query can now check the `status` field to determine whether an empty list might be due to an error:

```graphql
query FetchUsers {
  users {
    status
    total
    users {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```

## Response types for mutations

> See also [Structuring mutation responses](/apollo-server/schema/schema#structuring-mutation-responses).

This response type pattern is even more useful for mutations, because they can result in many valid failure states (such as attempting to delete an object that doesn't exist).

For example, let's say we have an e-commerce graph. When executing a `checkout` mutation, it's valid for that mutation to fail if a purchased item is out of stock or the buyer has insufficient funds.

If we define a set of `ErrorResponse` types in our schema, front-end developers can provide customized experiences based on the type of failure that occurred:

```graphql
interface MutationResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
}

type CheckoutSuccess implements MutationResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  cart: [Product!]!
  invoice: Invoice!
}

interface ErrorResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  message: String!
}

type CheckoutError implements ErrorResponse {
  status: ResponseStatus!
  message: String!
}

union CheckoutResponse = CheckoutSuccess | CheckoutError

type Mutation {
  checkout(cart: ID!): CheckoutResponse!
}
```
