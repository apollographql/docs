title: Graphql as an Abstraction Layer

One of the advantages of using GraphQL is that it provides an abstraction between the consumers of the graph and 
the teams maintaining the backend services. 

In an backend-for-frontend (BFF) architecture, each BFF connects to a number of backend services. As you add new BFFs for each application, the number of connections proliferates and a change to any of the backing APIs/components has major implications.

## Example: Service Migration

Imagine an architecture with 10 applications, each with it's own BFF. The company is migrating one of many backend APIs to a 
different technology. As a result of the BFFs owning data orchestration, the organization must update 10 different BFFs or Experience APIs. Clients must be aware of what is happening during 
those changes, must track timelines, track changes to field names, etc.

```


However, if that company was using GraphQL as an abstraction layer, the consumers don't need to know about this change as the backing services 
have been abstracted behind the schema of the graph by the organization. The only change needed is at the GraphQL layer.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
%%{init:{'flowchart':{'nodeSpacing': 10, 'rankSpacing': 200}}}%%
  app1["🖥️ App"]
  app2["📱 App"]
  app3["📱 App"]
  app4["🖥️ App"]
  app5["🖥️ App"]
  app6["🖥️ App"]
  app7["📱 App"]
  app8["📱 App"]
  app9["🖥️ App"]
  app10["🖥️ App"]

  oldservice["❌ Old Service ❌"]
  newservice["✨ New Service ✨"]
  graphql["✅ GraphQL ✅"]

  app1 --> graphql
  app2 --> graphql
  app3 --> graphql
  app4 --> graphql
  app5 --> graphql
  app6 --> graphql
  app7 --> graphql
  app8 --> graphql
  app9 --> graphql
  app10 --> graphql

  graphql --> oldservice
  graphql -.-> newservice
```

As a company grows, this could potentially eliminate hundreds of updates, deployments, dependencies, or more due to the reduced impact of changes to backing services.

## Conclusion
GraphQL provides a great tool to abstract away the complexities of your backing services from your front end consumers. It can 
shield your consumers from major changes to those services while also reducing the impact of those changes across your architecture. Ultimately, It provides choice and control to your
consumers without negatively impacting your backing services.
