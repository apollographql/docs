We recommend that you read through this checklist and identify critical features for your team before your supergraph begins handling production traffic.

## GraphOS Studio

- Ensure that you've created multiple [variants](/graphos/graphs/#variants) to represent the different environments where your supergraph runs (for example, production, staging, and development).
- [Protect your production variant](/graphos/graphs/studio-features#protected-variants-enterprise-only) to avoid accidental changes while working in Studio.

## Apollo Router

- Ensure that you've correctly configured [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/setup/) and [GraphOS schema usage reporting](/router/configuration/telemetry/apollo-telemetry).
- For security, [turn off introspection](/router/configuration/overview/#introspection) for all production routers (by default the router disables introspection, but make sure you are not using `--dev` mode).
  - You can continue to view and fetch your GraphQL schemas from GraphOS and run operations from [GraphOS Studio Explorer](/graphos/explorer).
- Configure the [router traffic shaping](/router/configuration/traffic-shaping) features:
  - Set request and subgraph level timeouts and rate limits
  - Deduplicate subgraph requests
  - Communicate with subgraphs using APQ
- Enable [operation limits](/router/configuration/operation-limits) to block large and malicious requests
- Configure additional [tracing, metrics, and logging](/router/configuration/telemetry/overview) through OpenTelemetry or Prometheus
- Enable the operation and query plan [distributed cache](/router/configuration/distributed-caching)
- Optionally, enable any [other features](/router/enterprise-features/) deemed critical for your deployment of Apollo Router

## Subgraphs/servers

- For security, [turn off introspection](/apollo-server/api/apollo-server/#introspection) for all production GraphQL subgraphs.
  - You can continue to view and fetch your GraphQL schemas from GraphOS and run operations from [GraphOS Studio Explorer](/graphos/explorer).
- Ensure that you've integrated [`rover subgraph check`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-check) and [`rover subgraph publish`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-publish) into your CI/CD pipeline.
- If your subgraph servers are listed as [compatible with `FEDERATED TRACING`](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/), ensure that you've enabled [federated traces](/federation/metrics/), and that you can view operation metrics as expected in Apollo Studio.
  - Enable [fractional trace sampling via `fieldLevelInstrumentation`](/graphos/metrics/field-usage/#fractional-sampling) to reduce performance hits due to tracing.
- Ensure that you've [load-tested your graph](/technotes/TN0035-load-testing-graphql/).
  - Test loads should be representative of your current traffic (both in terms of volume and in terms of the actual operations you execute in the test).
  - To investigate performance issues, use Apollo Studio to identify which operations are performing slowly.
    - Look at resolver execution times to identify slow areas of execution.
    - Whenever possible, avoid making multiple calls to data sources within a single resolver.
    - Understand [query plan execution](/federation/query-plans) to help understand slow operations and optimize your supergraph to avoid them.
- Consider adding caching layers.
  - Apollo Server supports [automatic persisted queries (APQ)](/apollo-server/performance/apq/) out of the box.
    - If using Apollo Server, ensure that you use a [distributed caching system](/apollo-server/performance/cache-backends) for APQ in production to avoid cache inconsistency across server instances.
    - Optionally use the [`@cacheControl` directive](/apollo-server/api/plugin/cache-control) to enable your CDN to cache APQ GET requests using the `Cache-Control` header.
  - Optionally add [full response caching](/apollo-server/performance/caching/) to improve performance.

## Clients

- Ensure that your [clients identify themselves](/graphos/metrics/client-awareness/) by name and version.
  - If you're using an Apollo Client library, you can add a client name and version to the constructor.
  - For example, the [React client uses the `name` and `version` attributes](/react/api/core/ApolloClient#name) in the constructor options.
  - If you're using a third-party GraphQL client, set the `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` HTTP headers for each request to identify your client.
  - For an example of enforcing client identification in your gateway, see [this tech note for Client ID enforcement](/technotes/TN0001-client-id-enforcement/).
- Consider adding caching layers.
  - Enable [Persisted Queries and/or Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ)](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/persisted-queries) support for request-size savings.
  - Enable and configure the client side [normalized cache](/react/caching/overview)
