We recommend that you complete this checklist before your supergraph begins handling production traffic from clients.

## In Apollo Studio

- Ensure that you've created multiple [variants](/graphos/graphs/overview#variants) to represent the different environments where your supergraph runs (production, staging, and so on).
  - Optionally, [protect your production variant](/graphos/graphs/studio-features#protected-variants-enterprise-only) to avoid accidental changes while working in Apollo Studio.
- Ensure that your [clients identify themselves](/graphos/metrics/client-awareness/) by name and version.
  - If you're using an Apollo Client library, you can add a client name and version to the constructor.
    - For example, the [React client uses the `name` and `version` attributes](/react/api/core/ApolloClient#name) in the constructor options.
  - If you're using a third-party GraphQL client, set the `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` HTTP headers for each request to identify your client.
  - For an example of enforcing client identification in your gateway, see [this technote for Client ID enforcement](/technotes/TN0001-client-id-enforcement/).

## Server-side

- For security, disable introspection for all production GraphQL servers.
  - You can continue to view and fetch your GraphQL schemas from Apollo Studio.
- Ensure that you've correctly configured [managed federation](/federation/managed-federation/setup/).
- Ensure that you've integrated [`rover subgraph check`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-check) and [`rover subgraph publish`](/rover/commands/subgraphs#subgraph-publish) into your CI/CD pipeline.
- If your [subgraph servers are listed as compatible with `ftv1`](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs/), ensure that you've enabled [federated traces](/federation/metrics/), and that you can view operation metrics as expected in Apollo Studio.
  - Enable [fractional trace sampling via `fieldLevelInstrumentation`](/graphos/metrics/field-usage/#fractional-sampling) to reduce performance hits due to tracing.
- Consider adding caching layers.
  - Apollo Server and the Apollo Router both support [automatic persisted queries (APQ)](/apollo-server/performance/apq/) out of the box.
    - If you're using an Apollo Client library, make sure to enable APQ support.
    - If using Apollo Server, ensure that you use a [distributed caching system](/apollo-server/performance/cache-backends) for APQ in production to avoid cache inconsistency across server instances.
    - Optionally use the [`@cacheControl` directive](/apollo-server/api/plugin/cache-control) to enable your CDN to cache APQ GET requests using the `Cache-Control` header.
    - Additionally, you can configure your gateway can send APQ requests to your subgraphs.
      - [See the example below.](#apollo-gateway-apq-example)
  - Optionally add [full response caching](/apollo-server/performance/caching/) to improve performance.
- Ensure that you've load-tested your graph.
  - Test loads should be representative of your current traffic (both in terms of volume _and_ in terms of the actual operations you execute in the test).
  - To investigate performance issues, use Apollo Studio to identify which operations are performing slowly.
    - Look at resolver execution times to identify slow areas of execution.
    - Whenever possible, avoid making multiple calls to data sources within a single resolver.
    - Understand [query plan execution](/federation/query-plans) to help understand slow operations and optimize your supergraph to avoid them.

### Apollo Gateway APQ example

This example uses both the [`buildService`](/federation/api/apollo-gateway/#buildservice) option and the [`RemoteGraphQLDataSource`](/federation/api/apollo-gateway/#apq) class to enable APQ to each subgraph.

```js
import {ApolloServer} from '@apollo/server';
import {startStandaloneServer} from '@apollo/server/standalone';
import {ApolloGateway, RemoteGraphQLDataSource} from '@apollo/gateway';
import {readFileSync} from 'fs';

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl: readFileSync('./supergraph.graphql').toString(),
  buildService: ({url}) => {
    return new RemoteGraphQLDataSource({url, apq: true});
  }
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway
});

// Note the top-level await!
const {url} = await startStandaloneServer(server);
console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
```
