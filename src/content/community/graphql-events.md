The team at Apollo loves to speak at events, help community members looking to speak about GraphQL or Apollo, and organize quality events. Read on to see how you can get involved!

## Bookmark our events hub

[Apollo events](https://apollographql.com/events/) is where you can find all of our upcoming events and webinars as well as any recordings from our past events. If you want to keep up to date on GraphQL best practices, Apollo open source updates, new product features, and more, make sure to check the events regularly! 

## Give a talk

Whether you're gearing up to give a GraphQL or Apollo talk at a local meetup or a large industry event, we want to help spread the word and set you up with the resources to feel prepared. [Let us know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/apollographql) about events you're submitting to, when you're planning to speak, or when your talk videos have been published!

## Meetups

There over 50 meetups around the world featuring talks by and for GraphQL developers. Find the one [nearest you](https://www.meetup.com/topics/graphql/) or [get in touch](mailto:community@apollographql.com) for support in organizing one yourself!

### GraphQL SF

We organize the largest GraphQL meetup right at our headquarters in San Francisco, and are always looking for quality talks about GraphQL from speakers, local or visiting. [Let us know](mailto:community@apollographql.com) if you have a talk idea you'd like to present. 

## GraphQL Summit

We organize [GraphQL Summit](http://summit.graphql.com), the first yearly conference dedicated to GraphQL developers. Summit is the best place to learn how companies are using GraphQL in production, check out the future of the technology, and meet the friendly community working to support and advance it. We're always looking for speakers, so [reach out](mailto:summit@graphql.com) to the Summit team if you're interested in presenting in the future!

## Apollo Day

Apollo Day is a hands-on summit for Apollo's top users and contributors that we organize yearly (for now) in San Francisco. Watch videos from the last Apollo Day [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx5ndQ5okhg&list=PLpi1lPB6opQzWZwqnG0YIrWcSS3kH5SR8) and stay tuned for news about the next one in 2018!
