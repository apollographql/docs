## Give a talk

Whether you're gearing up to give a GraphQL or Apollo talk at a local meetup or a large industry event, we want to help spread the word and set you up with the resources to feel prepared. [Let us know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/apollographql) about events you're submitting to, when you're planning to speak, or when your talk videos have been published!

## Meetups

There over 50 meetups around the world featuring talks by and for GraphQL developers. Find the one [nearest you](https://www.meetup.com/topics/graphql/) or [get in touch](mailto:community@apollographql.com) for support in organizing one yourself!

## GraphQL Summit

We organize [GraphQL Summit](http://summit.graphql.com), the first yearly conference dedicated to GraphQL developers. Summit is the best place to learn how companies are using GraphQL in production, check out the future of the technology, and meet the friendly community working to support and advance it. We're always looking for speakers, so [reach out](mailto:summit@graphql.com) to the Summit team if you're interested in presenting in the future!
