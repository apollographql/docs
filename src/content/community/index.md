Welcome! The Apollo community is made up of developers around the world who are building awesome things with GraphQL. In this section, you can learn how to get help with Apollo and GraphQL, contribute to Apollo projects, and attend events and talks organized by the community.

## Join the Community

Come chat with Apollo team members, contributors, and developers on the [Apollo forums](https://community.apollographql.com/). It’s a great place to get help using Apollo and discuss the latest in the GraphQL community.
