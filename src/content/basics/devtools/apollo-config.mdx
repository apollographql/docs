title: Configuring Apollo VS Code
description: How to configure Apollo VS Code with apollo.config.js
---

If you're using the [Apollo VS Code extension](./editor-plugins/), you'll need to have an `apollo.config.js` (alternative file extensions: `cjs`, `mjs` and `ts`) project to get the features those tools bring.

The `apollo.config.js` file is meant to describe configuration for a single project only. If used in a monorepo with multiple projects, there should be a separate config file for each project.

This document describes all the options available in the Apollo config and defines which are required versus optional.

## Client projects

Client projects are configured through a top level `client` key in the config.

```js
module.exports = {
  client: { ... }, // highlight-line
};
```

### `client.service`

**Required** - the Apollo CLI and VS Code extension rely on knowledge of your schema to show you "IntelliSense" (for example, autocomplete on fields, metrics annotations, query validation).

There are a few different ways you can link your client to a schema:

1. Use the Apollo [schema registry](/graphos/delivery/publishing-schemas/)
2. With a remote endpoint (from a running server)
3. With a local schema file

#### Option 1: Use the Apollo schema registry

To link your client to a schema through the Apollo schema registry, you'll need to have at least one version of your schema published to the [registry](/graphos/delivery/publishing-schemas/).

With GraphOS Studio set up, you can point your client directly to your graph's schema by specifying your graph's name in your Apollo config, like so:

```js {3}
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: "my-apollo-service", // the name of your graph in Studio
  },
};
```

<Note>

You must have a [published schema](/graphos/delivery/publishing-schemas/) for features like VS Code IntelliSense, which requires knowledge of your schema, to work properly.

</Note>

If you're tracking different versions of your schema in the registry using graph variants, you can link your client to a specific variant like so:

```js {3}
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: "my-apollo-service@staging", // "staging" is the graph variant we're using
  },
};
```

If a graph variant is not specified, Apollo tools will fall back to the default value of `current`.

#### Option 2: Link a schema from a remote endpoint

Remote endpoints can be used to pull down a schema from a running service. This can be configured like so:

```js {3-11}
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: {
      name: "github",
      url: "https://api.github.com/graphql",
      // optional headers
      headers: {
        authorization: "Bearer lkjfalkfjadkfjeopknavadf",
      },
      // optionally turn off SSL validation check
      skipSSLValidation: true,
    },
  },
};
```

#### Option 3: Link a schema from a local file

In some cases you may have a locally generated file with your schema that you want to link. This can be either a `.graphql` file with the schema in SDL form or a saved introspection result in `.json`. To link your client project to a local schema file, configure it like so:

```js {3-6}
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: {
      name: "my-service-name",
      localSchemaFile: "./path/to/schema.graphql",
    },
  },
};
```

### `client.includes`

_Optional_ - by default, Apollo tools will look under a `./src` directory to find all operations and SDL to extract.

Client projects often contain client-side schema definitions for local state with Apollo Client. To make sure the Apollo CLI and VS Code extension can find these files and read them correctly, you may need to tell Apollo which folders to look for your schema and queries in like so:

```js {3}
module.exports = {
  client: {
    includes: ['./imports/**/*.js'], // array of glob patterns
    service: ...
  },
};
```

### `client.excludes`

_Optional_ - by default, Apollo tools will exclude `**/node_modules` and `**/__tests___` when looking for your queries and schema files.

If you want Apollo to ignore any of your other folders when looking for queries and schema definitions, adjust your config like so:

```js {3}
module.exports = {
  client: {
    excludes: ['**/__tests__/**/*'], // array of glob patterns
    service: ...
  },
};
```

### `client.tagName`

_Optional_ - custom tagged template literal.

When using GraphQL with JavaScript or TypeScript projects, it is common to use the `gql` tagged template literal to write out operations. Apollo tools will be looking through your files for the `gql` tag to extract your queries, so if you use a different template literal, you can configure it like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  client: {
    tagName: "graphql", // highlight-line
    service: ...
  }
};
```
