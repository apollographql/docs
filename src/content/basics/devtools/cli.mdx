title: The Apollo CLI
---

<Caution>

All `apollo service:*` commands are now deprecated in favor of commands in the [Rover CLI](/rover/).

</Caution>

The Apollo CLI provides useful commands for interacting with every component of the Apollo platform, including Apollo Client, Apollo Server, and GraphOS Studio.

## Download and install

The Apollo CLI is available as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) package.

### Project-level installation (recommended)

If your project uses `npm`, we recommend installing the Apollo CLI locally by adding it to your project's `devDependencies`, like so:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npm install -D apollo
```

This helps make sure that all your project's collaborators have the same version of the Apollo CLI installed.

### Global installation

You can install the Apollo CLI globally in your development environment with the following command:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npm install -g apollo
```

## Provide an API key

Like all other tools, the Apollo CLI requires an API key to communicate with GraphOS Studio. For each of your projects, [obtain a graph API key](/graphos/api-keys/#graph-api-keys) for the project's associated graph, and set that key as the value of `APOLLO_KEY` in your application's `.env` file:

```js title=".env"
APOLLO_KEY=service:docs-example-graph:NYKgCqwfCyYPIm84WVXCdw
```

Alternatively, you can provide an API key to individual CLI commands with the `--key` option:

```
apollo client:check --graph=MyGraph --key=service:docs-example-graph:NYKgCqwfCyYPIm84WVXCdw
```

## Supported commands

Most of the Apollo CLI's commands are in the following namespaces:

- `client` (such as `apollo client:codegen`) for interactions involving Apollo Client and GraphOS Studio
- `service` (such as `apollo service:check`) for interactions involving Apollo Server and GraphOS Studio

<Caution>

All `apollo service:*` commands are now deprecated in favor of commands in the [Rover CLI](/rover/).

</Caution>

For a full list of commands in a particular namespace, use the `apollo help` command:

<Note>

Omit `npx` from the example commands below if you [installed the Apollo CLI globally](#global-installation).

</Note>

```
$ npx apollo help client
Check a client project against a pushed service
