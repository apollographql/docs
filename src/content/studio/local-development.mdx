title: Developing your supergraph locally
description: With the Rover CLI
---

While you're working on changes to one of your subgraphs, you can run a version of your entire supergraph locally in your development environment! To do this, you use the `rover dev` command.

> [Install the Rover CLI.](/rover/getting-started/)

The `rover dev` command monitors each of your subgraph schemas (either via server introspection or by watching a `.graphql` file). Whenever it detects a change, it automatically recomposes your router's supergraph schema and raises any errors that might occur. This enables you iterate quickly on schema changes.

## Starting your router

You run `rover dev` once for _each subgraph_ in your supergraph. The _first_ time you run it, Rover spins up a router on your local machine.

Try running `rover dev` with an example subgraph like so:

```bash
rover dev --url https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ --name locations
```

You'll see output like the following:

```
WARN: could not detect a schema in the current working directory. to watch a schema, pass the `--schema <PATH>` argument
👂 polling https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ every 1 second
⚠️  Do not run this command in production! ⚠️  It is intended for local development.
🛫 starting a session with the 'locations' subgraph
🎶 composing supergraph with Federation v2.1.2
🚀 your supergraph is running! head to http://localhost:3000 to query your supergraph
```

You can now open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and run test queries against your local router using the Explorer!

You can replace the example subgraph URL and name in the above command with the details for your own subgraph. You can provide a remote URL or a `localhost` URL.

## Adding a subgraph

To add a subgraph to your local supergraph, run `rover dev` _again_ in a separate terminal window.

You can add a subgraph to this article's example supergraph with the following command:

```bash
rover dev --url https://flyby-reviews-sub.herokuapp.com/ --name reviews
```

This command's output is similar to the output for the _initial_ execution, but it includes a line like the following:

```
🐤 adding the 'reviews' subgraph to the session
```

This indicates that `rover dev` has identified your existing supergraph session and is adding this subgraph to it.

Now if you run test queries in the Explorer, you'll see that they can include fields from both the `locations` and `reviews` subgraphs!

## Ending a `rover dev` session

To shut down your local supergraph, use `CTRL+C` to terminate the _first_ `rover dev` process you started. This automatically terminates all _secondary_ `rover dev` processes that are part of the same session.

> If you terminate a _secondary_ `rover dev` process, your session remains active, and the router's schema is automatically updated to reflect the removed subgraph.

## Command options

For more details on `rover dev` options, see the [Rover documentation](/rover/commands/dev/).
