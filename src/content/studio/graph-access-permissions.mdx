## Public variants

You can enable public access for individual variants of your graph. If you do, **anyone with that variant's public link** can view the following pages for that variant in Studio:

- Home
  - This shows the variant's README.
- Schema
- Explorer
  - You can also [embed the Explorer](../explorer/embed-explorer/) on your own webpage.

This enables consumers of your graph to learn about your graph's schema and any special usage information (such as authentication details) that you've documented in [the public variant's README](#the-readme-page). They can also run properly authenticated operations against your graph with the Explorer.

People outside your organization can't view any _other_ pages for a public variant (Fields, Operations, etc.), and they can never view _any_ pages for private variants. New variants always start as private.

### Making a variant public

> Only organization members with the [**Org Admin** or **Graph Admin** role](./org/members/) can toggle a variant's public visibility.

1. Go to your variant's Settings page and open the **This Variant** tab.
2. Find the Public card and click **Change**:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="./img/toggle-public-protected-variant.png"
     alt="Toggle public variant in Studio"
     width="400"
   />

3. Toggle your selection and click **Save**.

You can toggle the switch back to **Off** to make the variant private again.

After you make a variant public, you can click the variant's **PUBLIC** label at the top of Apollo Studio to get its public link:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  src="./img/public-variant-label.jpg"
  alt="Public variant label in Studio"
  width="400"
/>

## Protected variants (Enterprise only)

If you have an Enterprise plan, you can designate particular variants of a graph as **protected variants**. Making a variant protected specifically affects the ability of users with the [**Contributor** role](./org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) to make certain changes to the variant:

- **Contributor**s _cannot_ push schema updates to a protected variant.
- **Contributor**s _cannot_ manage Explorer-related settings for a protected variant, like setting its URL.
- Graph API Keys with the **Contributor** permission _cannot_ report usage metrics to your graph.

These are the only operations (other than creating new protected variants and creating new graphs) that can be performed by **Contributor**s and not by **Observer**s, so one way of thinking of protected variants are that they are variants where **Contributor**s are treated as **Observer**s.

**Graph Admin**s and **Org Admin**s can configure whether a variant is protected from the **This Variant** tab of the variant's Settings page.

## Internal graph visibility (Enterprise only)

> For _external_ graph visibility, see [Public variants](#public-variants).

By default, graphs are visible to all members of your organization. If you have an Enterprise plan, you can set a graph to instead be visible only to members you invite.

You can configure visibility and grant your organization's members explicit access to your graph from the Access tab of your graph's Settings page.

Note that **Org Admin**s can always see _all_ graphs in your organization.
