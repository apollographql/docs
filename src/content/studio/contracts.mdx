title: Contracts
description: Deliver subsets of your enterprise supergraph
---

> Contracts are available only for [Enterprise plans](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/). Currently, they only support [federated variants](/federation/) of Studio graphs.

Apollo Studio **contracts** enable you to deliver different subsets of your supergraph to different consumers. Each contract filters specific portions of your supergraph's [API schema](/federation/federated-types/overview/#federated-schemas) into a different Studio variant:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph "Source variant";
  api("API schema<br/>▉");
  end
  subgraph "Contract variant B"
  contractB("Contract schema B<br/>▟")
  end
  subgraph "Contract variant A"
  contractA("Contract schema A<br/>▛");
  end
  api -."Filter schema<br/>according to contract A".->contractA
  api -."Filter schema<br/>according to contract B".->contractB
```

A contract filters definitions from your subgraph schemas based on `@tag` directives that you add:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql {4} title="Source variant subgraph schema"
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  codename: String! @tag(name: "internal")
}
```

```graphql title="Contract variant API schema"
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  # codename field is filtered out
}
```

</CodeColumns>

In the above example, a contract excludes types and fields marked with the `internal` `@tag`.

## What are contracts for?

You usually create a contract to support a **contract router** or **contract documentation** (or both).

#### Contract routers

You can deploy a [managed instance](/federation/managed-federation/overview/) of your graph router that uses a contract schema. Clients that use a contract router's endpoint can only execute GraphQL operations that the contract schema supports:

```mermaid
graph BT;
  adminapp(Admin app);
  userapp(User app);
  subgraph " ";
    standardgateway(["Standard router<br/>▉"]);
    contractgateway(["Contract router<br/>▟"]);
    subgraphs[["(All subgraphs)"]];
  end;
  userapp -.- contractgateway;
  adminapp -.- standardgateway;
  standardgateway & contractgateway --- subgraphs;
  class adminapp,userapp secondary;
```

This enables you to hide experimental types and fields that are still in development, or to limit a particular audience's access to only the portions of your graph that they need.

Contract routers can safely connect to the same subgraph instances as any other router, because their clients can only interact with data that's represented in the contract schema. This does not affect internal routing (filtered fields can still be used in a `@requires` selection set).

> Any `@tag`s that are present in a source variant's supergraph schema are _also_ present in a contract variant's supergraph schema.

#### Contract documentation

In Studio, each contract variant has its own README, schema reference, and Explorer. If you [make a contract variant public](./graph-access-permissions/#public-variants), you can provide these resources to external client developers to help them interact with a specific portion of your graph (while omitting irrelevant types and fields).

## Setup

> ⚠️ The Apollo Studio steps below require an organization member with the **Org Admin** or **Graph Admin** role. [Learn about member roles.](./org/members/)

### 1. Update your router and subgraphs

**Before you create any contracts:**

1. For Federation 2 contract variants, ensure that you're running gateway versions higher than 2.0.2. For Federation 1 contract variants, update your gateway's `@apollo/gateway` library to version 0.34.0 or later. Otherwise, you'll encounter runtime errors.
2. For Federation 2 contract variants, update your Apollo Server subgraphs to use version 2.0.0 or later of the `@apollo/subgraph` library. For Federation 1 contract variants, update `@apollo/subgraph` to version 0.1.1 or later.
   - `@apollo/subgraph` recently replaced `@apollo/federation` for Apollo Server instances acting as subgraphs. Symbol names are unchanged.
3. If you're still using the Apollo CLI to publish subgraph schemas (via `apollo service:push`), [install the Rover CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/) and begin using [`rover subgraph publish`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/subgraphs/#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-apollo-studio) instead.

Older versions of the above libraries and tools don't fully support the required `@tag` directive.

### 2. (Fed1) Enable variant support for `@tag`

> **This step is required for Federation 1 supergraphs only.** If you have a Federation 2 supergraph, proceed to the next step.

A contract uses one of your graph's existing [variants](/studio/org/graphs/#managing-variants) (called the **source variant**) to generate its contract schema. If your source variant uses Federation 1, you need to enable its support for the `@tag` directive in Apollo Studio.

Open the Settings page for the variant you want to use as your source variant, then select the **This Variant** tab:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Edit supported directives in Studio"
  src="./img/contract-variant-settings.jpg"
  width="600"
/>

In the **Build Configuration** section, click **Edit Configuration** and enable support for `@tag`.

### 3. Add `@tag`s

With contracts, you apply the `@tag` directive to types and fields in your subgraph schemas to indicate whether to include or exclude them from your **contract schema**.

Before you can add `@tag`s, you need to define the directive in your subgraph schema. The way you do this depends on which version of federation you're using:

<ExpansionPanel title="Federation 1">

Add the following definition to each of your subgraph schemas:

```graphql
directive @tag(name: String!) repeatable on
  | FIELD_DEFINITION
  | INTERFACE
  | OBJECT
  | UNION
```

</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="Federation 2">

Add the `@tag` directive to your subgraph schema's Federation 2 `import` array:

```graphql {3}
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@tag"])
```

</ExpansionPanel>

For example, let's take a look at this Federation 2 subgraph schema:

```graphql {1-3,6,11} title="products.graphql"
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key", "@tag"])

type Query {
  topProducts: [Product!]! @tag(name: "partner")
}

# All fields of the Product object type automatically inherit
# the "partner" tag so we can avoid tagging them individually
type Product @key(fields: "upc") @tag(name: "partner") {
  upc: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  # highlight-start
  internalId: ID! @tag(name: "internal")
  percentageMatch: Float! @tag(name: "experimental")
  # highlight-end
}
```

This schema applies the `@tag` directive to the following locations:

* The `Product` object type
* The `Query.topProducts` field (which returns a list of `Product`s)
* Two fields of `Product` (`internalId` and `percentageMatch`)

Each `@tag` has a string `name`. You tag types and fields with the _same_ `name` if they should be included or excluded as a group by a particular contract.

For in-depth details on valid `@tag` usage, see [Rules for `@tag`s and contracts](#rules-for-tags-and-contracts).

> Whenever Studio composes your source variant's [supergraph schema](/federation/#federated-schemas), that schema retains all of the `@tag`s from your subgraph schemas (this is different from most other directives, which are removed by default).

### 4. Publish updated subgraph schemas

After you're done adding tags, update your source variant by publishing your updated subgraph schemas to Apollo Studio.

> After publishing, if Studio doesn't reflect the the tags that you've added in your subgraph schemas, make sure you've [updated all required libraries and tools](#1-update-your-router-and-subgraphs). If you obtain your subgraph schemas via introspection, older subgraph libraries might strip the `@tag` directive.

Now you're ready to create your first contract!

### 5. Create a contract

Open your source variant's Settings page and select the **This Variant** tab. This time, click **Contracts**:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Contract settings in Studio"
  src="./img/contract-create.jpg"
  width="550"
/>

Click **Create Contract** to open the following dialog:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Create contract dialog"
  src="./img/contracts-dialog.jpg"
  width="550"
/>

#### Basic details

In the first step of the dialog, provide the following:

- A name for your new contract variant
- The source variant to use

> You can't change these values after the contract is created.

Then click **Continue**.

#### Contract filters

Next, you specify tag-based filters for your contract:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Create contract dialog"
  src="./img/contract-tags.jpg"
  width="550"
/>

The dialog detects all tag names that are used in your source variant's schema, and it populates its dropdown lists with those names. You can add any number of tag names to each list.

> You can also add tag names that aren't yet present in your source variant's schema. If you later add tags with that name, the contract honors them.

Your contract will filter types and fields from its source variant according to the following rules:

- **If the Included Tags list is empty**, the contract schema _includes_ each type and object/interface field _unless_ it's tagged with an _excluded_ tag.
- **If the Included Tags list is non-empty**, the contract schema _excludes_ each union type and object/interface field _unless_ it's tagged with an _included_ tag.
  - Each object and interface type is _included_ as long as _at least one_ of its fields is included (unless the type is explicitly excluded)
  - The contract schema _excludes_ a type or field if it's tagged with both an included tag _and_ an excluded tag.

> 💡 In Apollo Federation 2, if you want to exclude a type or field from your _source variant's_ API schema _and_ all of its contract schemas, you can use the `@inaccessible` directive instead of `@tag`. For details, see [Using `@inaccessible`](/federation/federated-types/sharing-types/#using-inaccessible).

When you're finished adding tag names, click **Generate Preview**. Studio attempts to generate a contract schema based on the filters you provided and displays the result:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Result of contract preview generation"
  src="./img/contract-generate-preview.jpg"
  width="300"
/>

After you generate the preview, you can click **Review** to continue to the next step.

#### Review and launch

You can now review all of the details of your contract:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Create contract dialog"
  src="./img/contract-review.jpg"
  width="550"
/>

If everything looks right, click **Create**. This kicks off the generation of your contract variant and its initial contract schema as a [launch](./launches).

> Studio might encounter an error while generating your contract schema. For descriptions of these errors, see [Error types](#error-types).

### 6. Use your new contract variant

Congratulations! You've created a contract in Apollo Studio. You can now use your contract variant to provide a [contract router or contract documentation](#what-are-contracts-for) to your users.

For example, you can complete the [managed federation setup](/federation/managed-federation/setup/) for a new router instance that uses your contract variant.

## Federation 1 limitations

Contracts behave slightly differently depending on which version of Apollo Federation your graph uses (1 or 2). Most importantly, graphs that use Federation 1 _cannot_ use `@tag`s to exclude the following from a contract schema:

* Custom scalar types (default scalar types can _never_ be excluded)
* Enum types or their values
* Input types or their fields
* Arguments of object fields or interface fields

### Contracts and Federation 2

To create a contract variant that uses Federation 2, the contract's source variant must _also_ use Federation 2.

> [Learn how to move an existing variant to Federation 2.](/federation/federation-2/moving-to-federation-2#step-2-configure-your-composition-method)

#### Moving an existing contract to Federation 2

If a Federation 1 source variant already has one or more associated contracts, it isn't possible to move that variant or its contract variants to Federation 2. Instead, you need to **delete and recreate** your contract variants with the following steps:

1. Identify the source variant you want to move to Federation 2.
2. Save the details for each of that source variant's existing contract variants (most importantly each variant's associated filters).
3. Delete all of the source variant's existing contract variants.
4. Now that the source variant has no associated contracts, you can configure it to use Federation 2 composition ([learn how](/federation/federation-2/moving-to-federation-2#step-2-configure-your-composition-method)).
5. Recreate your deleted contract variants, which will now use Federation 2 composition like the modified source variant.

## Automatic updates

Apollo automatically updates your contract schema whenever any of the following occurs:

- Studio successfully composes an updated supergraph schema for the contract's source variant.
- You [edit your contract](#editing-a-contract).

This makes sure that your contract schema reflects the latest version of your source variant's schema, and that the correct types and fields are included and excluded.

Updates to your contract schema are automatically fetched by your managed [contract routers](#contract-routers).

## Editing a contract

> You can't change an existing contract's name or source variant. Instead, you can create a _new_ contract (and delete the existing contract variant if you no longer need it).

After you create a contract, you can edit its lists of included and excluded tags. From the Contracts list in your graph's Settings page, click **Edit Contract** where shown:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Edit contract menu"
  src="./img/contract-edit.jpg"
  width="550"
/>

This opens a dialog similar to the one you used to create the contract.

If you make any changes to the contract's included or excluded tags, Studio automatically runs [contract checks](#contract-checks) to determine whether those changes will affect any clients that user your contract variant.

The result of these checks is shown in the Review Schema step of the contract edit dialog:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Contract edit dialog with checks result"
  src="./img/contract-edit-check.jpg"
/>

## Contract checks

> ⚠️ **Important:** To run contract checks via `rover subgraph check`, you must [update the Rover CLI](/rover/getting-started/#installation-methods) to v0.8.2 or later.
>
> - **If you use Rover v0.8.0 or v0.8.1,** contract checks _do_ run, but Rover ignores any contract check failures in [blocking downstream variants](#failing-contract-checks) you've set.
> - **If you use a version prior to v0.8.0,** `rover subgraph check` does not run contract checks _at all_.

If you run [schema checks](./schema-checks/) in Apollo Studio (which we recommend for all graphs), those checks include **contract checks** for any variant that acts as a source variant for contracts. Contract checks help your team identify when proposed changes to a source variant will negatively affect one or more downstream contracts.

When you run schema checks on a source variant, contract checks execute alongside the other types of checks for that variant (composition checks and operation checks).

> Contract checks rely on the supergraph schema that's generated by composition checks, so they _don't_ execute if that composition _fails_.

Contract checks do the following for **each** of a source variant's associated contracts:

1. Use the source variant's proposed supergraph schema (generated by composition checks) to generate and validate an updated contract schema
2. Run operation checks against the updated contract schema

On your graph's Checks page in Studio, contract checks are shown as **Downstream**:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Downstream checks shown in Studio UI"
  src="./img/contract-check-ui.jpg"
/>

You can click the **Downstream** item in the Tasks column to view a summary of all contract checks that ran, and you can click a particular check to view more details:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Downstream checks shown in Studio UI"
  src="./img/contract-downstream-workflows.jpg"
/>

### Failing contract checks

Unlike with other types of checks, failing contract checks **don't** cause their associated schema checks workflow to fail by default. This means that the `rover subgraph check` command doesn't return an error state that would prevent a CI task from merging or deploying changes to the source variant.

If you _do_ want failing contract checks to fail your entire checks workflow, you can set **blocking downstream variants** for your source variant. If contract checks fail for any of these specified contract variants, the source variant's checks workflow _does_ fail.

To set blocking downstream variants:

1. Open your source variant's Checks page and select the **This Variant** tab.
2. Click **Configuration** and scroll down to the **Blocking Downstream Variants** section:

    <img
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Blocking downstream variants for checks"
      src="./img/contract-blocking-variants.jpg"
    />

3. Select each contract variant that should be a blocking downstream variant.

You're done! From now on, whenever schema checks run for your source variant, those checks _will_ fail if contract checks fail for _any_ blocking downstream variant.

## Error types

Whenever Apollo Studio attempts to create or update your contract schema, it might encounter an error. Errors are identified by the step in the creation process where they occurred:

| Error                                      | Description                                                                                                                        |

## Rules for `@tag`s and contracts

### Valid `@tag` locations

**In both Federation 1 and Federation 2,** you can apply tags to the following to filter your contract schema:

- Definitions of object, interface, and union types
- Fields of object types (Federation 1 doesn't support tagging fields of interface types)
    - In Federation 1, you can still make an interface field inaccessible by tagging the interface definition, or by ensuring that object fields that implement the interface field are removed.

**In Federation 2 only,** you can _also_ apply tags to the following:

- Fields of interface types
- Enum types and their values
- Input types and their fields
- Definitions of custom scalar types
- Arguments of fields, **but not directive arguments at this time**

### Valid `@tag` names

- Tag names can include alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), along with hyphen (`-`) and forward slash (`/`).
- Each tag name cannot exceed 128 characters.

```graphql {3}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @tag(name: "a/b/c/1-2-3")
}
```

### Dependent `@tag`s

- Whenever you tag the definition of an object or interface type, Studio automatically considers that tag to be applied to _all fields_ of that type:

    ```graphql
    type InternalUser @tag(name: "internal") {
      id: ID! # Also considered to have @tag(name: "internal")
    }
    ```

- Whenever you tag the definition of an object, interface, or union type, **you should always** apply that same tag to every field that _returns_ that type:

    ```graphql {1,7}
    type BillingAccount @tag(name: "internal") {
      id: ID!
      acctNumber: String!
    }

    type Query {
      billingAccounts: [BillingAccount!]! @tag(name: "internal")
    }
    ```

  - If you don't do this, a contract might exclude a type while including fields that return that type. This produces an invalid contract schema.

- If a contract excludes an object that implements an interface or is included in a union:

  - The contract is _not_ required to exclude schema fields that return that interface or union, as long as at least one other associated object type remains:

      ```graphql {1,7,13,20}
      # Two object types implement this interface.
      interface Identity {
        id: ID!
        name: String!
      }

      # If this implementing type is excluded...
      type InternalUser implements Identity @tag(name: "internal") {
        id: ID!
        name: String!
      }

      # ...but this implementing type remains...
      type ExternalUser implements Identity {
        id: ID!
        name: String!
      }

      type Query {
        # ...then this field doesn't need to be excluded.
        currentIdentity: Identity
      }
      ```

  - **However**, if a subgraph resolves one of these fields by returning an object of an excluded type, a runtime error occurs in the router and the operation fails.

### Special cases for filtering

- If a contract defines a list of Included Tags, any object or interface type _without_ an included tag is still included in the contract schema _if_ at least one of its _fields_ is included:

    ```graphql
    # This type definition is included because one if its fields is included.
    type User {
      id: ID! @tag(name: "includeMe")
    }
    ```

- If a contract excludes _every field_ of an object or interface type, the entire type definition is excluded from the contract schema:

    ```graphql
    # This object type is excluded because all of its fields are excluded.
    type User {
      id: ID! @tag(name: "excludeMe")
    }
    ```

  - This can produce an invalid contract schema if any fields that _return_ the excluded type are included.

- If a contract excludes _every object type_ that's part of a union type, the entire union type definition is excluded from the contract schema:

    ```graphql
    # This union type is excluded because all of its possible types are excluded.
    union Media = Book | Movie

    type Book @tag(name: "excludeMe") {
      title: String!
    }

    type Movie @tag(name: "excludeMe") {
      title: String!
    }
    ```

  - This can produce an invalid contract schema if any fields that _return_ the excluded union type are included.

- A contract _cannot_ exclude any of the following, even if tagged:
  - Built-in scalars (`Int`, `Float`, etc.)
  - Built-in directives (`@skip`, `@include`, etc.)
  - Custom directives that are applied to type system locations ([see the list](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#TypeSystemDirectiveLocation))

- A contract _can_ exclude object fields that are used in a computed field's [`@requires` directive](/federation/entities-advanced/#contributing-computed-entity-fields) without causing runtime errors.
