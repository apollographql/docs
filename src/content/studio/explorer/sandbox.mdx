title: Apollo Sandbox
description: Use Studio's devtools without an Apollo account
---

**Apollo Sandbox** is a special mode of Apollo Studio that is meant to be used for local development.
Sandbox loads with a schema from introspection as opposed to a schema from the Apollo registry and provides access to a subset of Studio's devtools:

- [The Explorer](./explorer/)
- Schema reference
- [Schema checks](../schema-checks/) and diffs against registered graphs (for logged-in users)

Sandbox can be used offline and without an Apollo account.
You can use Sandbox in our hosted environment on Apollo Studio or [run it yourself](/studio/explorer/sandbox#embedding-sandbox).

## Connecting to a GraphQL server

When you open Sandbox, it automatically attempts to connect to a GraphQL server running at `http://localhost:4000`. You can use the box at the top of the Explorer to change this URL to any local or remote GraphQL endpoint that's accessible by your browser:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/sandbox-url.jpg"
  alt="Sandbox URL field"
  width="300"
/>

> To try out Sandbox with an example GraphQL API, you can set the URL to `https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index`.

## Publishing schemas from Sandbox

> ⚠️ Sandbox does not yet support publishing subgraph schemas to Studio for a [federated graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).

If you're signed in to Sandbox with your Apollo account, you can publish your GraphQL server's schema to a new Studio graph.

To do so, first click **Publish** at the top of the Explorer. The following dialog appears:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/sandbox-publish.jpg"
  alt="Publishing schemas to Studio from Sandbox"
  width="400"
/>

1. Use the dropdown menu to choose an organization for your new graph.
2. Provide a title for your graph.
3. If you've created any [Sandbox operation collections](./operation-collections/#sandbox-collections), you can copy those over to your new graph by checking the box.
   - This option doesn't appear if you haven't created any Sandbox collections.
4. Click **Confirm**.

When Sandbox finishes publishing your schema, it redirects you to your new graph in Studio.

## Schema diffs

If you log into Apollo Studio, you can diff the schema in your Sandbox against any graph you have access to in the registry.

From [Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/), open the **Schema Diff** page from the left navigation panel. Then use the dropdown menus to select any accessible organization, graph, and variant to compare against:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/sandbox-diff.jpg"
  alt="Schema diff in Sandbox"
/>

> If you're using Sandbox with a subgraph, this diff shows the schema as originally defined, not the generated subgraph schema that includes federation-specific fields like Query.\_entities. You can view the generated subgraph schema from the SDL page in Sandbox.

In addition to viewing the diff on this page, you can click **Run a Check** in the upper-right to run [schema checks](#schema-checks) against the currently selected variant.

## Schema checks

If you log into Apollo Studio, you can run a Schema Check between the schema in your Sandbox and a graph you have access to in the Apollo registry.

> [Schema checks](../schema-checks/) require [usage reporting data](../metrics/usage-reporting/) from your GraphQL server.
>
> Organization members with the [`Consumer` role](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) cannot run schema checks.

From [Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/), open the **Checks** page from the left navigation panel:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/sandbox-checks-select.jpg"
  alt="Sandbox select variant for checks"
  width="400"
/>

Select any accessible organization, graph, and variant to check against and click **Run a check**. When the check completes, Sandbox displays a result summary:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/sandbox-checks-result.jpg"
  alt="Sandbox checks result"
  width="400"
/>

To view the result's _full_ details in Studio, click **Go to details**.

#### Subgraph checks

You can run subgraph checks on federated graphs. If you're using Sandbox with a subgraph, you can use the subgraph dropdown to select which subgraph you want to check your changes against.

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/subgraph-sandbox-check-prompt.jpg"
  alt="Sandbox subgraph check prompt"
  width="500"
/>

When you click **Run a check**, Studio first performs a composition check using your local subgraph schema and the registered schemas of your other subgraphs. If composition succeeds, Sandbox then performs operation checks as usual and displays the results of all checks. If composition fails, Sandbox does not perform operation checks and displays the composition error.

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/subgraph-sandbox-one-check-failed.jpg"
  alt="Sandbox subgraph check result"
  width="500"
/>

## Offline Sandbox

You can use Sandbox _without_ an internet connection if you're querying a graph running on `localhost`. To do so, [open Sandbox in your browser](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/) at least once while connected to the internet. You can then use that browser to open Sandbox while offline.

### Reconnecting

Sandbox automatically reconnects to Apollo Studio whenever your internet connection is restored. When it does, it might display a notification that your Apollo Studio application version is stale by at least 24 hours. You can click the notification to update _all_ of your browser's open Apollo Studio tabs to the latest version.

> This notification indicates only that the Apollo Studio _UI_ is out of date. Your Studio _data_ is always kept up to date.

## Operation collections in Sandbox

See [this section](./operation-collections/#sandbox-collections).

## Embedding Sandbox

In addition to using [Studio's hosted version of Sandbox](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox), you can also embed Sandbox on your own website.
This may be useful for bootstrapping a GraphQL IDE onto a development endpoint or an endpoint with CORS restrictions.

To embed Sandbox on an HTML page:

```html
<div
  style="width: 100vw; height: 100vh; position: absolute; top: 0"
  id="embeddableSandbox"
></div>
<script src="https://embeddable-sandbox.cdn.apollographql.com/_latest/embeddable-sandbox.umd.production.min.js"></script>
<script>
  new window.EmbeddedSandbox({
    target: "#embeddableSandbox",
    initialEndpoint: window.location.href,
    // optional
    includeCookies: false,
    // optional
    handleRequest: (endpointUrl, options) =>
      fetch(endpointUrl, {
        ...options,
        headers: {
          ...options.headers,
          authorization: `token ${token}`,
        },
      }),
  });
</script>
```

In general, we recommend you **only embed Sandbox in development environments**.
Sandbox is powered by schema introspection and we recommend [turning off introspection in production](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/graphql/security/why-you-should-disable-graphql-introspection-in-production/).
If you want to provide a **similar experience to Embedded Sandbox on a production endpoint**, we recommend using Studio's [Public Graphs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/org/graphs#public-variants) or [Embedded Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/embed-explorer).
