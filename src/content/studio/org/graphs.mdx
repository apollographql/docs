title: Understanding graphs
description: The heart of Apollo GraphOS
---

As its name suggests, **GraphOS** is a platform for building and managing **graphs**. Each graph corresponds to a GraphQL service in your organization.

A GraphQL service usually runs in more than one environment (such as staging or production), so every graph in GraphOS has one or more **variants** that each correspond to one environment:

```mermaid
graph TB;
  subgraph "A graph in GraphOS";
    direction LR
    staging(Staging<br/>variant);
    production(Production<br/>variant);
  end;
```

Each variant of a graph keeps track of its own separate GraphQL schemas and operation metrics.

## Graph types

Every graph in GraphOS is one of these graph types:

<table>

<thead>
<tr>
<th>
Graph type

<th>

</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

[Cloud supergraph](#cloud-supergraphs)

</td>
<td>

A federated supergraph consisting of:

* A GraphOS-hosted router
* One or more subgraphs hosted in your infrastructure

**Recommended** for all organizations getting started with GraphOS.

</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

[Self-hosted supergraph](#self-hosted-supergraphs)

</td>
<td>

A federated supergraph consisting of:

* A router hosted in your infrastructure
* One or more subgraphs hosted in your infrastructure

Recommended for organizations that require full customization of their router, usually for advanced performance or data compliance reasons.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

[Monograph](#monographs)

</td>
<td>

**Not recommended.** A single GraphQL service hosted in your infrastructure with _no_ router.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

### Cloud supergraphs

> Cloud supergraphs require an Apollo organization on the **Serverless (Free)** or **Serverless** plan. [Learn more about plans.](./plans/)

**Cloud supergraphs** are recommended for every organization that's getting started with GraphOS. For every variant of a cloud supergraph, GraphOS provisions and manages a **router** that acts as the variant's public endpoint. Application clients communicate with this endpoint instead of communicating directly with your API:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "GraphOS";
  router(["Router"]);
  end;
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  api[Your GraphQL API];
  router --- api
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

The router automatically reports certain operation metrics to GraphOS, so you don't need to configure this reporting in your GraphQL servers.

> [Learn more about cloud routing.](../cloud-routing/overview/)

Cloud supergraphs use an architecture called [Apollo Federation](/federation/). With federation, you distribute your supergraph's capabilities across _multiple_ GraphQL services, which are known as **subgraphs**. The router executes client operations across multiple subgraphs as needed:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "GraphOS";
  router(["Router"]);
  end;
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  products[Products subgraph];
  reviews[Reviews subgraph]
  router --- products & reviews
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

Even if your API currently uses only _one_ GraphQL server, a cloud supergraph helps you add more subgraphs later as your organization grows.

### Self-hosted supergraphs

> If you need to host your supergraph's router in your own infrastructure, you might also benefit from the expanded features of an [Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/). Please [contact us](https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales/).

With a self-hosted supergraph, GraphOS does _not_ provision a router for your supergraph. Instead, you host your supergraph's router in your own infrastructure:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure"
  router(["Router"]);
  serviceA[Products subgraph];
  serviceB[Reviews subgraph];
  router --- serviceA & serviceB;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

Your self-hosted router is usually an instance of [the Apollo Router](/router/) (cloud supergraphs use the Apollo Router under the hood).

> [See the Apollo Router docs.](/router/)

Self-hosted supergraphs provide full control over your router, but they also require handling its deployment and management. Before you adopt this graph type, make sure you have the necessary team structure to properly manage an additional service in your infrastructure.

### Monographs

A **monograph** is a graph that consists of a single GraphQL server with _no_ router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure"
  server[GraphQL server];
  end;
  clients -.- server;
  class clients secondary;
```

⚠️ **We strongly recommend _against_ monographs!** A monograph introduces significant technical _and_ logistical scaling issues as more teams contribute to your graph and its schema.

Additionally, a graph router provides more functionality than just support for multiple subgraphs: it also enables powerful features like [`@defer` support](/router/executing-operations/defer-support/) and straightforward [metrics reporting](../metrics/usage-reporting/).

## Creating graphs

**To create a cloud supergraph,** see the [quickstart](../getting-started/).

**To create a _non_-cloud graph** (i.e., a self-hosted supergraph or a monograph), see the instructions for your plan type:

<ExpansionPanel title="Serverless plans">

1. Go to your organization's **Supergraphs** tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/).

    - **If you see this dialog...**

        <img
          src="../img/studio-welcome.jpg"
          class="screenshot"
          alt="Welcome message for new Studio orgs"
          width="400"
        />

        ...then click **Coming from Apollo Odyssey, or want to connect a self-managed router?**

    - **Otherwise,** find the following notice in the bottom-right corner of the page:

        <img
          src="../img/classic-graph-flow.jpg"
          class="screenshot"
          alt="Link to classic graph flow"
          width="300"
        />

        Click **Head over to our classic graph flow**.

    In either case, Studio displays the following dialog for creating a graph:

    <img
      className="screenshot"
      src="../img/graph-creation.jpg"
      width="350"
      style="margin-bottom: 20px;"
    />

2. Specify an organization and title for your graph.

3. Specify your **Graph Architecture**:

    * To create a self-hosted supergraph, leave this as **Supergraph (default)**.
    * To create a monograph, switch this to **Monolith**.

4. Click **Next**. A dialog like the following appears (the details differ depending on which **Graph Architecture** you're using):

    <img
     src="../img/register-schema-dialog.jpg"
     class="screenshot"
     alt="Schema registration options"
     width="500"
    />

5. **If you're using Apollo Federation,** select the version of federation you're using from the **Supergraph Pipeline Track** dropdown.

Your graph has been created, and your Studio organization now includes a **Classic Graphs** tab in addition to its **Supergraphs** tab.

> Note that the **Supergraphs** tab is only for _cloud_ supergraphs. Your self-hosted supergraphs are under the **Classic Graphs** tab.

Next, you need to publish your graph's schema(s) to Apollo using the Rover CLI. For details, see [Publishing schemas to Apollo Studio](../schema/cli-registration).

</ExpansionPanel>

## Variants

To distinguish between instances of the same graph running in different environments (such as staging and production), you define multiple **variants** of your graph. Each variant has its own schemas, along with its own change history and metrics.

Each of your graph's variants is shown in Apollo Studio:

<img
  src="../img/graph-variants.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema Changelog tab"
  width="400"
/>

### Creating a variant

To create a new variant for your graph, you [publish a schema](../schema/cli-registration) to the graph and include the variant's name in the command. If a variant with the specified name doesn't exist yet, Studio creates it!

## Publishing schemas

See [Publishing schemas to GraphOS](../schema/cli-registration/).
