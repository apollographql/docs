subtitle: Use custom scripts to manage auth flows and test response data
description: Use preflight and operation scripts to manage authentication and validate GraphQL operations in the Apollo GraphOS Explorer.
---

The GraphOS Explorer can run custom scripts when executing each GraphQL operation, similar to tools like Postman. These JavaScript-based scripts can populate the values of [environment variables](./connecting-authenticating/#environment-variables) that the Explorer then injects into HTTP header values or GraphQL variables. This can be useful for:

- Managing authentication flows like OAuth, for example, by refreshing an expired access token
- Validating response data and workflows that depend on response data

## Script types

You can define two different types of scripts:

- [**Preflight scripts**](#preflight-scripts): You can define a single preflight script _per variant_ of a graph. This script runs before _every Explorer operation_ that's executed against the associated variant.
  - Preflight scripts are helpful for enabling organization-wide Explorer authentication to your graph.
- [**Operation scripts**](#operation-scripts): If you use [operation collections](./operation-collections/), you can define one pre- and one post-operation script for each saved operation in a collection.
  - Operation scripts are helpful for testing or debugging the behavior of individual operations or [operation chains](#chaining-operations).
  - Pre-operation scripts run before the operation executes.
  - Post-operation scripts run after the operation executes.

If you define and use all possible scripts for a particular operation, the order is as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Preflight["Preflight script<br/> (for all operations in a variant)"]
    PreOp[Pre-operation <br/>script]
    Op[[Operation <br/>execution]]
    PostOp[Post-operation <br/>script]
    Preflight --> PreOp --> Op --> PostOp
    class Preflight secondary;
    class Op tertiary;
```

## Important considerations for Explorer scripts

- Scripts are stored in the Apollo cloud **in plaintext**.
  <Caution>

  **Do not include secret credentials in scripts.** Instead, team members can provide their individual credentials to the Explorer via [environment variables](./connecting-authenticating/#environment-variables).

  </Caution>

- If a team member has view access to a particular graph variant or operation collection, that team member can _also_ view any scripts associated with that variant or operation collection.
- Preflight scripts are **on** by default. Individual team members can [turn them off](#turn-off-preflight-scripts) for their own Explorer usage.
- Operations scripts are **off** by default. Individual team members can [turn them on](#turn-on-operation-scripts) for their own Explorer usage.

## Preflight scripts

### Add preflight scripts

<Note>

For [protected variants](../graphs/studio-features/#protected-variants-enterprise-only), only organization members with the **Graph Admin** role can create or edit a variant's preflight script.

For _non_-protected variants, members with the **Contributor** role can also modify the preflight script.

</Note>

To create a preflight script:

1. [Open GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content) and then open the Explorer for the graph and variant you want to create a script for.

2. Open the Explorer's Settings tab and scroll down to the **Preflight Script** section:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/preflight-script.png"
     alt="Preflight script settings in the Explorer"
     width="500"
   />

3. Click **+ Add script**. The following dialog appears:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/preflight-script-edit.jpg"
     alt="Editing preflight scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

4. Click **Show snippets** to display a list of common helpful actions you can perform from your preflight script. Examples include sending HTTP requests and interacting with Explorer environment variables.

5. Develop your script in the **Script editor** panel. As you develop, you can click **Test script** to test its execution. Console messages are printed in the **Console output** panel.

6. When your script is ready, click **Save**. Studio stores your script.

That's it! After you save your script, it's automatically loaded for any team member that uses the Explorer with the associated variant.

### Turn off preflight scripts

By default, a variant's preflight script runs automatically before every GraphQL operation that's executed in the Explorer. Team members can turn off the script for their individual Explorer usage from the **Personal Settings > Scripts** section of the Explorer's Settings tab:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/preflight-script-disable.png"
  alt="Turn off preflight scripts in the Explorer"
  width="500"
/>

To do so, toggle the **Preflight script** switch to **OFF**.

## Operation scripts

### Add operation scripts

<Note>

You can only create operation scripts for operations that are saved in an [operation collection](./operation-collections/).

Only organization members [with edit access](../org/members/#role-permissions) to a particular operation collection can create or edit operation scripts for that collection.

</Note>

1. From the Explorer, open an operation from the Operation Collections menu:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/select-operation.png"
     alt="Selecting an operation"
     width="400"
   />

2. From the Explorer's bottom panel, select the **Pre-Operation Script** or **Post-Operation Script** tab and click **+ Add Script**:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/new-operation-scripts-tab.png"
     alt="Adding a new operation script"
     width="500"
   />

   The following modal appears:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/op-script-modal.png"
     alt="Editing operation scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

3. Create, test, and save your script.

   - For details on script creation, see steps 4 and 5 of [Add preflight scripts](#add-preflight-scripts).

   - The operation script modal has a **Mocked Operation Response** area so you can test post-operation scripts. Scripts can access any JSON GraphQL response you add in the **Mocked Operation Response** via the [`explorer.response.body`](#explorerresponsebody) variable.

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/op-postflight-script-modal.png"
     alt="Editing operation scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

   - Click **Test script** to test your script before saving it.

After you save an operation script, make sure to [turn it on](#turn-on-operation-scripts) so that it runs before or after its designated operation execution in the Explorer. 

### Turn on operation scripts

By default, operation scripts are **off** for each individual team member. Team members can turn on operation scripts for their individual Explorer usage from the **Personal Settings > Scripts** section of the Explorer's Settings tab:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/op-switch.png"
  alt="Editing operation scripts in the Explorer"
  width="500"
/>

To do so, toggle the **Operation script** switch to **ON**.

## Chaining operations

A script can use the [`explorer.runOperation`](#explorerrunoperation) function to execute _another_ operation that's saved in a collection. That operation might have its _own_ script, which can _also_ call `explorer.runOperation`.

You can use this mechanism to chain together a sequence of operations for more advanced workflows.

## Scripting API reference

These symbols are available within the scope of both preflight scripts and operation scripts. Snippets for these symbols are available via the **Show snippets** link in the scripting modal.

## Examples

### Get an enviroment variable

Scripts can access an environment variable [set in the Explorer's settings](./connecting-authenticating#defining) like so:

```js
const secretToken = explorer.environment.get('token');
```

### Set an environment variable

The following example runs an operation and sets an environment variable for use in future operations:

```js
const response = await explorer.runOperation({
  scope: "shared",
  graphRef: "SpaceX-pxxbxen@current",
  collectionName: "Mission Control",
  operationName: "Ships",
});

const firstShipID = response.result.data.ships[0].id;

explorer.environment.set("shipID", firstShipID);
```
