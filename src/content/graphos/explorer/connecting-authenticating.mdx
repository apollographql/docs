title: Connecting and authenticating with the Explorer
---

The Explorer automatically attempts to connect to your GraphQL server at the URL specified in its Settings tab.

> When you use the Explorer with a [cloud supergraph](../graphs/overview/#cloud-supergraphs), the endpoint URL is always the URL of your current variant's GraphOS-managed router.

Depending on your GraphQL server's settings, you might need to configure the Explorer's connection to handle CORS requirements or authentication.

## CORS policies

Requests from the Explorer go straight from your browser to your GraphQL server, so your endpoint will see requests coming from the `https://studio.apollographql.com` domain.

It's common for public endpoints to have [CORS policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) that restrict which domains can query them. If your endpoint has CORS protections enabled, you probably need to safelist `https://studio.apollographql.com` in your CORS policy to use the Explorer.

To do so, include the following header(s) in your server's responses:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://studio.apollographql.com

# Include this one only if your server also authenticates via cookies.
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

> If you can't change your CORS policy, you might be able to create a proxy for your endpoint and point the Explorer to the proxy instead. CORS policies are enforced by browsers, and the proxy won't have the same issues communicating to your endpoint.

## Authentication

The Explorer currently enables you to authenticate via [request headers](#request-headers), [cookies](#cookies), and [preflight scripts](#preflight-scripts).

> If your graph has authentication requirements that aren't covered by these options, please contact **support@apollographql.com** with questions or feedback.

### Request headers

The bottom panel of the Explorer includes a Headers tab where you can set headers that are included in your operation's HTTP request.

Headers can include the values of [environment variables](#environment-variables), which are specified with double curly braces as shown:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/explorer-headers.jpg"
  alt="Setting Explorer headers with environment variables"
  width="500"
/>

### Cookies

If your server uses cookies to authenticate, you can configure your endpoint to share those cookies with `https://studio.apollographql.com`.

To set this up, your [cookie's value must contain `SameSite=None; Secure`](https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site). Additionally, these CORS headers must be present in your server's response to Studio:

```bash
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://studio.apollographql.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

Once configured, requests sent from `https://studio.apollographql.com` will carry the cookies from your domain when you run queries with the Explorer. If you're logged in on your domain, requests from the Explorer will also be logged in. If you log out on your domain and the cookie is removed, requests from the Explorer will be logged out.

### Environment variables

The Explorer's Settings tab includes a section for providing Environment Variables. Here, you can provide sensitive information that you can then include in header values or [preflight scripts](#preflight-scripts). This enables you to share operations (including headers) with other team members _without_ exposing sensitive data.

For example, you can define a `token` environment variable like so:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/explorer-environment-variables.jpg"
  alt="Setting Explorer environment variables"
  width="300"
/>

You can then include that environment variable in header values with double curly braces, as shown:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/explorer-use-environment-variable.jpg"
  alt="Setting Explorer headers with environment variables"
  width="400"
/>

If you share this operation with team members, your value for `token` is _not_ shared, and other users can provide their own value.

### Scripting

Similar to tools like Postman, the Explorer can run custom **preflight scripts** before each GraphQL operation.
In general, the main purpose of scripting is to populate environment variables that can be used as header values or graphql variables.
Scripts can also be useful for debugging purposes.

There are two places in the Explorer to write these scripts:

#### Preflight Script

- It may be helpful to think of this as the global or parent preflight script,
  since as long as the feature is turned on in the settings it will always execute before any other script or operation
- This script is identical for every team member that uses the Explorer with a particular variant. Global preflight scripts are especially useful for managing authentication flows like OAuth, for example by refreshing an access token.
- The global preflight script applies to a _single variant_ of a particular graph, so you can define different ones for each of your graph's environments.

#### Operation Scripts

- Each operation in an [Operation collection](./operation-collections/) can define a script which executes before the operation runs.
- Operation Scripts have the same capabilities as the preflight script, the main differences are:
  - There can be as many scripts as there are saved operations
  - The order in which they execute
  - The access controls for viewing and editing are slightly different (need to ask what's different exactly)

#### ⚠️ Important considerations for preflight scripts

- All team members with access to a variant can _view_ that variant's preflight script.
- For [protected variants](../graphs/studio-features/#protected-variants-enterprise-only), only organization members with the [`Graph Admin` role](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can _create or edit_ a variant's preflight script.
  - For _non_-protected variants, members with the `Contributor` role can also modify the preflight script.
- Preflight scripts are stored in the Apollo cloud in plaintext.
  - **Do not include secret credentials in preflight scripts!** Instead, team members can provide their individual credentials in the Explorer via [environment variables](#environment-variables).
- Team members can [disable](#disabling-preflight-scripts) the execution of a preflight script.
- Scripts can use the `explorer.runOperation` method to execute other saved operations which may also define their own scripts
  creating a chain of script & operation execution.

#### Creating a preflight script

To create a preflight script:

1. [Open Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/) and then open the Explorer for the graph and variant you want to create a script for.

2. Open the Explorer's Settings tab and scroll down to the **Preflight script** section:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/preflight-script.jpg"
     alt="Preflight script settings in the Explorer"
     width="500"
   />

3. Click **Add script**. The following dialog appears:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/preflight-script-edit.jpg"
     alt="Editing preflight scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

4. Click **Show snippets** to display a list of common helpful actions you can perform from your preflight script (such as sending HTTP requests and interacting with Explorer environment variables).

5. Develop your script in the **Script editor** panel. As you develop, you can click **Test script** to test its execution. Console messages are printed in the **Console output** panel.

6. When your script is ready, click **Save**. Studio stores your script.

You're done! After you save your script, it's automatically loaded for any team member that uses the Explorer with the associated variant.

#### Disabling preflight scripts

By default, a variant's preflight script runs automatically before every GraphQL operation that's executed in the Explorer. Team members can temporarily disable the script from the **Preflight script** section of the Settings tab. To do so, toggle the switch to **OFF**:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/preflight-script-disable.jpg"
  alt="Disabling preflight scripts in the Explorer"
  width="500"
/>

#### Creating an operation script:

Operation scripts are only available on operations that are saved in a [collection](./operation-collections/).

1. Select an operation from the Operation Collections menu

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/select-operation.png"
     alt="Selecting an operation"
     width="400"
   />

2. Select the Script tab and press the + Add Script button

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/script-tab-new.png"
     alt="Adding a new operation script"
     width="500"
   />

3. The operation script editor modal is very similar to the preflight script modal.

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../img/op-script-modal.png"
     alt="Editing operation scripts in the Explorer"
     width="600"
   />

For guidance on using this modal, refer to the section [Creating a Preflight Script](#creating-a-preflight-script).

**Double check that this toggle is in the desired position**

Found in the Explorer settings:

  src="../img/op-switch.png"
  alt="Editing operation scripts in the Explorer"
  width="600"
/>

#### Handlebars in the Variables Pane

It is possible to use handlebars to evaluate environment variables. Consider the following setup:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../img/handlebars-1.png"
  alt="An example of how to use handlebars in the variables pane. The name of our environment variable is wrapped with two enclosing curly braces on either side, all inside a string. 
  Assuming the environment variable has been populated and we use its name within the handlbars it will be interpolated to the desired value during the operation."
  width="600"
/>

However you may need to retrieve data from an operation with a script to correctly set the variable.
