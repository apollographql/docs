Every Apollo organization has an associated plan that determines which GraphOS features the organization has access to, along with how it's billed.

**Every newly created organization starts on one of the following:**

- The [**Serverless (Free)**](#current-plans) plan
- A free [Enterprise trial](#enterprise-trials) (which enables you to test out most GraphOS Enterprise features)

You can check your organization's current plan in GraphOS Studio. From your organization's page, go to the **Settings** tab and scroll down to the **Plan and Billing** section:

## Current plans

Apollo offers the following plans to new organizations:

<Note>

**These are brief summaries of each plan.** For complete plan details, see the [pricing page](https://apollographql.com/pricing).

| Plan                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Serverless (Free)**            | Provides access to Serverless [cloud supergraphs](../graphs/#cloud-supergraphs), along with many other GraphOS features. Sets a fixed limit on monthly Serverless operations. This plan is free.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Serverless**                   | Removes the operation limit of the **Serverless (Free)** plan, and is billed based on usage above that limit. Also expands metrics data retention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Dedicated <br/> (In preview)** | This plan lets you run a cloud router on dedicated, pre-provisioned infrastructure that you control and scale. It is currently in invite-only preview. <TrackableLink href="https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales?type=dedicated&referrer=docs" eventName="content_contact_cloud">Get in touch</TrackableLink> if you'd like to request access or have any questions. |
| **Enterprise**                   | The Enterprise plan features self-hosted routing, advanced security and schema delivery features, access control, and more. It does not support cloud supergraphs. It includes negotiable usage rates. You can try out most Enterprise features for free with an [Enterprise trial](#enterprise-trials).                                                                    |

<Tip>

An Enterprise plan provides access to all GraphOS Enterprise features, our Graph Champions community, and a dedicated support channel for your team to talk with Apollo supergraph experts. We'll work with you to customize a query volume limit and support package that's right for you.

### Enterprise trials

You can sign up for a GraphOS Enterprise trial to freely test out most [GraphOS Enterprise features](../#enterprise-features) (including [creating a self-hosted supergraph](../quickstart/self-hosted/)) for the duration of the trial period.

<Note>

The Enterprise trial period is **28 days**.

  >
    Start an Enterprise trial
  </ButtonLink>
</p>

With an Enterprise trial, you create a new GraphOS organization that behaves identically to a full Enterprise organization, except the following features are unavailable:

- Single sign-on (SSO)

You can identify your trial organization in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) by the `ENTERPRISE TRIAL` label next to its name in the upper left:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Label applied to Enterprise organizations in Studio"
  src="../img/trial-org-label.jpg"
  width="500"
/>

Studio also displays how many days remain in your trial in the upper right:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Enterprise trial duration indicator in Studio"
  src="../img/trial-org-timeleft.jpg"
  width="500"
/>

In the final few days of your trial period, Studio displays an additional notification banner.

At the end of the trial, you can contact Apollo to upgrade your organization to a full Enterprise organization. **If you don't, the organization becomes locked** ([see details](#ending-a-trial)).

#### Ending a trial

When your Enterprise trial period ends, your trial organization becomes locked unless you contact Apollo to upgrade to a full Enterprise organization (you can upgrade any time before or after the trial period ends).

You can't access a locked organization from GraphOS Studio, and GraphOS stops serving supergraph schemas and [Enterprise license](/router/enterprise-features#the-enterprise-license) to your [self-hosted routers](../quickstart/self-hosted/).

## Legacy plans

If you have a non-Enterprise Apollo organization that was created before **October 4, 2022**, it's on one of the following legacy plans.

<Note>

These plans do not support cloud supergraphs, and they might not support other new GraphOS features moving forward.

If your organization is on one of these plans, we strongly recommend [upgrading to a current plan](#upgrading-to-a-current-plan).

</Note>

| Plan     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free** | Our legacy Free plan, different from the current **Serverless (Free)** plan. Provides basic GraphOS features, with limited data retention and maximum query volume.                                                   |
| **Team** | Our legacy plan for small and medium teams, which is billed based on the number of team members (that is, seat-based). Raises the retention and query volume limits from the **Free** plan, but does not remove them. |

### Upgrading to a current plan

To create cloud supergraphs, your Apollo organization needs to be on either the **Serverless (Free)** plan or the **Serverless** plan.

**If your organization is on the legacy Free plan,** you can convert your organization to the current **Serverless (Free)** plan by clicking **Convert to Serverless (Free)** in the top-right corner of your organization's page in Studio:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="A screenshot of the Convert to Serverless (Free) button"
  src="../img/convert-to-serverless.jpg"
/>

**If you're on the legacy Team plan**, you currently need to create a new organization to be able to create cloud supergraphs.
