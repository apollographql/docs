title: Managing your Apollo plan
---

Every Apollo organization has an associated plan that determines which GraphOS features the organization has access to, along with how it's billed.

<blockquote>

**Every newly created organization starts on one of the following:**

- The [**Serverless (Free)**](#current-plans) plan
- A free [Enterprise trial](#enterprise-trials) (which enables you to test out most GraphOS Enterprise features)

</blockquote>

You can check your organization's current plan in GraphOS Studio. From your organization's page, go to the **Settings** tab and scroll down to the **Plan and Billing** section:

## Current plans

Apollo offers the following plans to new organizations:

> **These are _brief summaries_ of each plan.** For complete plan details, see the [pricing page](https://apollographql.com/pricing).

| Plan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Serverless (Free)** | Provides access to serverless [cloud supergraphs](../graphs/#cloud-supergraphs), along with many other GraphOS features. Sets a fixed limit on monthly serverless operations. This plan is free. |
| **Serverless** | Removes the operation limit included in the **Serverless (Free)** plan, and is billed based on usage _above_ that limit. Also expands metrics data retention. |
| **Enterprise** | These plans feature self-hosted routing, advanced security and schema delivery features, access control, and more. They include negotiable usage rates. They do _not_ currently support cloud supergraphs. You can try out most Enterprise features for free with an [Enterprise trial](#enterprise-trials). |

> An Enterprise plan provides access to all GraphOS Enterprise features, our Graph Champions community, and a dedicated support channel for your team to talk with Apollo supergraph experts. We'll work with you to customize a query volume limit and support package that's right for you.

### Enterprise trials

You can sign up for a GraphOS Enterprise trial to freely test out _most_ [GraphOS Enterprise features](../#enterprise-features) (including [creating a self-hosted supergraph](../quickstart/self-hosted/)) for the duration of the trial period.

> The Enterprise trial period is **28 days**.

    Start an Enterprise trial
  </ButtonLink>
</p>

With an Enterprise trial, you create a _new_ GraphOS organization that behaves identically to a full Enterprise organization, _except_ the following features are unavailable:

- Single sign-on (SSO)

You can identify your trial organization in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) by the `ENTERPRISE TRIAL` label next to its name in the upper left:

Studio also displays how many days remain in your trial in the upper right:

<img class="screenshot" alt="Enterprise trial duration indicator in Studio" src="../img/trial-org-timeleft.jpg" width="500" />

In the final few days of your trial period, Studio displays an additional notification banner.

At the end of the trial, you can contact Apollo to upgrade your organization to a full Enterprise organization. **If you don't, the organization becomes _locked_** ([see details](#ending-a-trial)).

#### Ending a trial

When your Enterprise trial period ends, your trial organization becomes _locked_ unless you contact Apollo to upgrade to a full Enterprise organization (you can upgrade any time before _or_ after the trial period ends).

You can't access a locked organization from GraphOS Studio, and GraphOS stops serving supergraph schemas and [Enterprise entitlements](/router/enterprise-features#the-enterprise-entitlement) to your [self-hosted routers](../routing/self-hosted/).

## Legacy plans

If you have a non-Enterprise Apollo organization that was created before **4 October 2022**, it's on one of the following legacy plans.

> These plans do _not_ support serverless cloud supergraphs, and they might not support other new GraphOS features moving forward.
>
> If your organization is on one of these plans, we strongly recommend [upgrading to a current plan](#upgrading-to-a-current-plan).

| Plan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Free** | Our legacy free plan, different from the current **Serverless (Free)** plan. Provides basic GraphOS features, with _very_ limited data retention and maximum query volume. |
| **Team** | Our legacy plan for small and medium teams, which is billed based on the number of team members (i.e., seat-based). Raises the retention and query volume limits from the **Free** plan, but does not _remove_ them. |

### Upgrading to a current plan

To create cloud supergraphs, your Apollo organization needs to be on either the **Serverless (Free)** plan or the **Serverless** plan.

**If your organization is on the legacy Free plan,** you can convert your organization to the current **Serverless (Free)** plan by clicking **Convert to Serverless (Free)** in the top-right corner of your organization's page in Studio:

<img class="screenshot" alt="A screenshot of the Convert to Serverless (Free) button" src="../img/convert-to-serverless.jpg" />

**If you're on the legacy Teams plan**, you currently need to create a _new_ organization to be able to create cloud supergraphs.
