title: Organizations in GraphOS
---

All data in GraphOS (graphs, schemas, metrics, etc.) is associated with a particular _organization_. Every organization has one or more [members](./members/) who manage it and can access its associated data.

<Tip>

Enterprise organizations have access to fine-grained access controls via additional [member roles](./members/#organization-wide-member-roles).

</Tip>

## Creating an organization

You create your first organization as part of the [account creation process](../quickstart/cloud/), unless you've been invited to an existing organization by another Apollo user.

You can create additional organizations by clicking **Create a new organization** at the bottom of your organization dropdown in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content):

<img
  src="../img/organization-list.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Studio organization list"
  width="300"
/>

A single organization can include any number of [graphs](../graphs/), so a single company rarely needs more than one or two organizations.

## Viewing your organizations

Click the organization dropdown at the top of the page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) to view the list of all organizations you belong to:

<img
  src="../img/organization-list.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Studio organization list"
  width="300"
/>

- Click on an organization to view its associated graphs and metrics.
- Each organization has a **Graphs** list, a **Members** management page, and a **Settings** page.

## Deleting an organization

<Caution>

This action can't be undone!

</Caution>

You can delete an organization at any time. Doing so removes all traces of the organization from GraphOS.

Deleting your organization does all the following:

- Removes all user memberships from the organization
- Permanently deletes all graphs from the organization, along with their associated data. These graph IDs cannot be reused later.
- Immediately terminates any plan subscription associated with the organization. We can't issue refunds for this, unfortunately.
