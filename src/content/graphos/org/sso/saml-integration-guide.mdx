title: Setting up Apollo SSO with a SAML-based IdP
---

<PremiumFeature>

**Single sign-on (SSO) is available only for [Dedicated and Enterprise plans](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#security).**
This feature is not available as part of an [Enterprise trial](../plans/#enterprise-trials).

</PremiumFeature>

This guide walks through configuring a generic SAML-based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo single sign-on (SSO). These steps require administrative access to your IdP.

<Note>

**If you use Okta or Azure Active Directory as your identity provider**, instead see the corresponding guide for your tool:

- [Okta](./okta-integration-guide/)
- [Azure AD](./azure-ad-integration-guide/)

</Note>

1. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

2. If possible, upload the appropriate Apollo SAML metadata for your organization:

   - If your organization **does not** already use the Entity ID `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml)
   - If your organization **does** already use `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml)

3. Set your **Single Sign on URL** or **ACS URL** to the following:

   `https://sso.connect.pingidentity.com/sso/sp/ACS.saml2`

   You can also use this value for the following fields:

   - **Recipient**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL**

4. Set your **Entity ID** according to the following:

   - If your organization **does not** already use `PingConnect` as an Entity ID, use `PingConnect`.
   - If your organization **does** already use `PingConnect`, use the following value:
     `fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

5. Set your **RelayState** to the following value:

   `https://pingone.com/1.0/fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

6. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

7. Assign users to the Apollo GraphOS application.

   - Reach out to your SSO or Identity & Access Management team for help assigning the relevant groups and users to `Apollo GraphOS`.

8. Send your Apollo contact your identity provider (IdP) SAML XML metadata file.

   **If you can't send this file,** send one of the following instead:

   - IdP entity ID
   - IdP single sign-on URL / SSO URL
   - IdP x509 certificate

9. Your Apollo contact will complete your SSO setup.
