description: Configure a SAML-based identity provider as your Apollo GraphOS organization's SSO provider.

<SSOPremiumFeature />

This guide walks through configuring a generic SAML-based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo SSO.
If you use Okta or Microsoft Entra ID as your IdP, instead see the corresponding guide for your IdP:

- [Okta](./okta-integration-guide/)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](./microsoft-entra-id-integration-saml-guide/) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)

## Setup

<SAMLSetupSteps idp="application" />

### Prerequisites

Setup requires:

- Administrative access to your IdP
- A GraphOS user account with the [**Org Admin** role](../members/#organization-wide-member-roles)

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

### Step 1. Enter your SSO details

<SSOShareDetails type="SAML" />

### Step 2. Create a custom application

1. Once you reach **Step 2: Your IdP and Apollo** in the wizard, open your IdP's admin dashboard in a separate browser tab.
2. Create a new application. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

3. If your IdP permits it, upload the SP SAML XML metadata file provided by the GraphOS setup wizard. Otherwise, open the XML metadata file, view the SAML metadata values, and manually enter them in your IdP.

   - Set your **Single Sign-on URL** or **ACS URL** to the Single Sign-on URL provided by the wizard. You can also use this value for the following fields:

     - **Recipient**
     - **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator**
     - **ACS (Consumer) URL**

   - Set your **Entity ID** to the Entity ID value provided by the wizard.

4. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` or `user.mail` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: Your IdP's email attribute, often something like `user.email`
   - `given_name`: Your IdP's first name attribute, often something like `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: Your IdP's last name attribute,often something like `user.lastName`

5. Save your configuration.
6. In the setup wizard in GraphOS Studio, select whether your IdP requires signing an AuthnRequest.
7. Click **Continue**.

### Step 3. Share SAML metadata with Apollo

In the setup wizard, enter your application's metadata URL or metadata file.
Consult your IdP's documentation if you need assistance finding it.
Click **Continue**.

### Step 4. Verify details

The GraphOS Studio setup wizard populates your SSO metadata based on the URL you entered in the last step. Verify the values are correct. Consult your IdP's documentation if you need assistance finding them.

Once you've verified the values or corrected them, click **Continue**.

### Step 5. Enable SSO

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

<SSOLegacyUsers idp="your IdP" appType="application" />

## Assign users in your IdP

Once your SSO setup is live, assign users to your new Apollo GraphOS application in your IdP.
Consult your IdP documentation if necessary.
For help assigning the relevant groups and users, contact your SSO or Identity & Access Management team.

## Legacy setup

<SSOLegacyCaution />

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to see legacy instructions">

1. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

2. If possible, upload the appropriate Apollo SAML metadata for your organization:

   - If your organization does not already use the Entity ID `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml)
   - If your organization does already use `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml)

3. Set your **Single Sign on URL** or **ACS URL** to the following:

   `https://sso.connect.pingidentity.com/sso/sp/ACS.saml2`

   You can also use this value for the following fields:

   - **Recipient**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL**

4. Set your **Entity ID** according to the following:

   - If your organization does not already use `PingConnect` as an Entity ID, use `PingConnect`.
   - If your organization does already use `PingConnect`, use the following value:
     `fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

5. Set your **RelayState** to the following value:

   `https://pingone.com/1.0/fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

6. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

7. Assign users to the Apollo GraphOS application.

   - Reach out to your SSO or Identity & Access Management team for help assigning the relevant groups and users to `Apollo GraphOS`.

8. Send your Apollo contact your identity provider (IdP) SAML XML metadata file.

   If you can't send this file, send one of the following instead:

   - IdP entity ID
   - IdP single sign-on URL / SSO URL
   - IdP x509 certificate

9. Your Apollo contact will complete your SSO setup.
