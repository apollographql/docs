<SSOPremiumFeature />

This guide walks through configuring a generic SAML-based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo SSO.
If you use Okta or Microsoft Entra ID as your IdP, instead see the corresponding guide for your IdP:

- [Okta](./okta-integration-guide/)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](./microsoft-entra-id-integration-saml-guide/) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)

## Setup

<SSOPreviewNotice />

SAML-based SSO setup has two main steps:

1. Create a custom Apollo GraphOS application in your IdP.
2. Send your application's SAML metadata to Apollo.

These steps generally require administrative access to your IdP.

### Step 1. Create a custom application

<SSOSAMLInfoRequest />

2. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

3. If your IdP permits it, upload the Apollo-provided SP SAML XML metadata file. Otherwise, open the XML metadata file, view the SAML metadata values, and manually enter them in your IdP.

   - Set your **Single Sign-on URL** or **ACS URL** to the Single Sign-on URL. You can also use this value for the following fields:

     - **Recipient**
     - **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator**
     - **ACS (Consumer) URL**

   - Set your **Entity ID** to the Entity ID value.

4. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

5. Save your configuration.

### Step 2. Send SAML metadata to Apollo

Send your Apollo contact your IdP SAML XML metadata file. If you can't send this file, send one of the following instead:

- IdP entity ID
- IdP single sign-on URL / SSO URL
- IdP x509 certificate

Your Apollo contact will then be able to complete your SSO setup.

Once your SSO setup is live, assign users to your new Apollo GraphOS application in your IdP. For help assigning the relevant groups and users, contact your SSO or Identity & Access Management team.

Once you've confirmed the new setup works as expected, remove any legacy Apollo GraphOS applications in your IdP.

## Legacy setup

<SSOLegacyCaution />

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to see legacy instructions">

1. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

2. If possible, upload the appropriate Apollo SAML metadata for your organization:

   - If your organization does not already use the Entity ID `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_pingconnect_signed_metadata.xml)
   - If your organization does already use `PingConnect`: [apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_metadata.xml)
     - If authentication requests need to be signed use: [apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml](apollo_studio_guid_signed_metadata.xml)

3. Set your **Single Sign on URL** or **ACS URL** to the following:

   `https://sso.connect.pingidentity.com/sso/sp/ACS.saml2`

   You can also use this value for the following fields:

   - **Recipient**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator**
   - **ACS (Consumer) URL**

4. Set your **Entity ID** according to the following:

   - If your organization does not already use `PingConnect` as an Entity ID, use `PingConnect`.
   - If your organization does already use `PingConnect`, use the following value:
     `fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

5. Set your **RelayState** to the following value:

   `https://pingone.com/1.0/fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

6. Set the following user attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

7. Assign users to the Apollo GraphOS application.

   - Reach out to your SSO or Identity & Access Management team for help assigning the relevant groups and users to `Apollo GraphOS`.

8. Send your Apollo contact your identity provider (IdP) SAML XML metadata file.

   If you can't send this file, send one of the following instead:

   - IdP entity ID
   - IdP single sign-on URL / SSO URL
   - IdP x509 certificate

9. Your Apollo contact will complete your SSO setup.
