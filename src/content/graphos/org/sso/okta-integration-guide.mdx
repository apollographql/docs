title: Set up SAML SSO with Okta
subtitle: Configure Okta as your GraphOS organization's identity provider
description: Configure Okta as your Apollo GraphOS organization's SSO provider with this SAML setup guide.
---

<SSOPremiumFeature />

This guide walks through configuring Okta as your GraphOS organization's identity provider (IdP) for SAML-based SSO. Once you've set up your integration, you need to assign users to it in Okta so they can access GraphOS Studio via SSO.

<SSORevokesInvitationLinks />

## Setup

SAML-based SSO setup has two main steps:

1. Create a custom Okta app integration for Apollo GraphOS.
2. Send your Okta app integration's SAML metadata to Apollo.

Setup requires an Okta account with administrator privileges.

### Step 1. Create a custom app integration

<Note>

To use the latest version of Apollo's SSO, ensure you are _creating a custom app integration_ in Okta rather than using the GraphOS app in the Okta Application Network.

</Note>

<SSOSAMLInfoRequest />

2. From your Okta Administrator Dashboard, go to the **Applications** view. Click **Create App Integration**.
3. In the dialog that appears, select **SAML 2.0** as your sign-in method. Click **Next**.
4. The **Create SAML Integration** dialog appears. In the **General Settings** step, provide the following values:

   - **App integration name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **Logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.jpg) (optional)

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-create-saml-integration.jpg"
     alt="Okta create SAML integration step"
     className="screenshot"
     width="800"
   />

   Then click **Next**.

5. In the **Configure SAML** step, provide the following values:

   - **Single sign on URL**: Single sign-on URL provided by Apollo
     - Also check **Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL**.
   - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Entity ID provided by Apollo
   - Leave the default values for other settings, including leaving the **RelayState** blank.

6. Still in the **Configure SAML** step, scroll down to **Attribute Statements**. Set values for the following attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

     className="screenshot"
     width="700"
   />

   Then click **Next**.

7. In the **Feedback** step, select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**. Click **Finish**.

### Step 2. Send SAML metadata to Apollo

1. In your new Okta SAML integration, go to the **Sign On > Settings > SAML 2.0 > Metadata details** section.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-metadata-url.jpg"
     alt="Okta settings"
     className="screenshot"
     width="500"
   />

2. Copy and paste the contents of the **Metadata URL** text box into a text file.
3. Send the **Metadata URL** to your Apollo contact. They will complete your SSO setup.

Once your SSO setup is finalized, you need to assign users to your custom app in Okta.

## Assign users in Okta

Once your SSO is set up, you need to assign users to it so they can access GraphOS. You can assign individual users or groups by following these steps:

1. From your Okta Administrator Dashboard, open the **Applications** view from the left menu and open the Apollo GraphOS integration. Then, click the **Assignments** tab.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-assignments.jpg"
     alt="GraphOS Studio Okta integration assignment settings"
     class="screenshot"
   />

2. Click the **Assign** drop-down and then **Assign to People** or **Assign to Groups**.
3. Click **Assign** on the right of the people or group(s) you want to have access to your GraphOS Studio Org. Click **Done**.

Repeat these steps whenever you want to grant GraphOS Studio access to a new user or group.
Okta displays every user and group you've assigned to the integration in the **Assignments** tab.

Once you've confirmed the new configuration works as expected, remove any legacy Apollo integrations in Okta if you have them.

## Legacy setup

<SSOLegacyCaution />

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to see legacy instructions">

With PingOne—Apollo's former SSO system—you could use Okta's GraphOS integration (now deprecated) or create a custom SAML integration.

### Using Okta's Apollo GraphOS integration (deprecated)

#### Supported features

The [Okta Apollo GraphOS SAML integration](https://www.okta.com/integrations/graphos-studio/) supports the following features:

- [Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/directory/ad-agent-add-update-jit.htm)
- Service provider-initiated (SP-initiated) SSO

An SP-initiated flow occurs when an end user signs in to an application directly from that application's sign-in page. For example, `https://studio.apollographql.com/login` is the sign-in location for GraphOS Studio. The integration supports users signing in from this page using SSO.

You can use Okta's [Bookmark App integration](#add-apollo-graphos-as-a-bookmark-app) to simulate an Identity Provider-initiated (IdP-initiated) flow to allow users to sign in from Okta.

#### Configuration

1. From your Okta Administrator Dashboard, open the **Applications** view from the left menu. Click **Browse App Catalog**.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-browse-catalog.jpg"
     alt="Okta Application screen"
     className="screenshot"
   />

2. Search for "Apollo GraphOS." When “Apollo GraphOS Enterprise” appears, click **+ Add integration**.
3. In the **General Settings** tab that opens, select **Do not display application icon to users**. (You'll [set up a Bookmark App](#add-apollo-graphos-as-a-bookmark-app) instead.) You can optionally change the **Application label** or keep the default "Apollo GraphOS Enterprise" label. Click **Done**.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-hide-integration.jpg"
     alt="GraphOS Studio Okta integration general settings"
     className="screenshot"
     width="750"
   />

4. The **Assignments** tab opens—you'll return to it later to [assign users](#assign-users-in-okta) to the integration. For now, open the **Sign On** tab and copy the **Metadata URL** under **Metadata details**.

<img
  src="../../img/sso/okta-metadata-url.jpg"
  alt="GraphOS Studio Okta integration sign on settings"
  className="screenshot"
  width="750"
/>

5. Send the following information to your Apollo contact:

- **Metadata URL** you copied in the last step
- **Email address** you use to log in to GraphOS Studio
  - The member associated with this email address will need an [org admin role](../members/#organization-wide-member-roles). You can begin SSO setup without it, but Apollo will update the role, if necessary, to complete setup.

Your Apollo contact will let you know once SSO setup is complete.

### Using a custom integration (legacy)

Beginning in April 2024, Apollo recommends using the updated instructions for [creating a custom integration](#configuration) provided above. You can refer to the instructions below if you need them for a previously created custom integration.

#### Step 1. Create an app integration

1. From your Okta Administrator Dashboard, navigate to the **Applications** view.
2. Click **Create App Integration**. The following dialog appears:

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-create-app-integration.jpg"
     alt="Okta create app integration modal"
     className="screenshot"
   />

3. Select **SAML 2.0** as your sign-in method.
4. Click **Next**. The **Create SAML Integration** dialog appears.

#### Step 2. Create a new SAML integration

The **Create SAML Integration** dialog includes multiple steps:

1. In the **General Settings** step, provide the following values:

   - **App name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.jpg) (optional)

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-create-saml-integration.jpg"
     alt="Okta create SAML integration step"
     className="screenshot"
   />

   Then click **Next**.

2. In the **Configure SAML** step, provide the following values:

   - **Single sign on URL**: `https://sso.connect.pingidentity.com/sso/sp/ACS.saml2`
     - Also check **Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL**.
   - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: `PingConnect`

     <Note>

     If `PingConnect` already exists, use `fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

     </Note>

   - **Default RelayState**: `https://pingone.com/1.0/fd76e619-6c0a-461c-912d-418278929d60`

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-configure-saml.jpg"
     alt="Okta configure SAML"
     className="screenshot"
   />

3. Still in the **Configure SAML** step, scroll down to **Attribute Statements**. Set values for the following attributes:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-attribute-statements.jpg"
     alt="Okta configure attributes statements"
     className="screenshot"
   />

   Then click **Next**.

4. In the **Feedback** step, provide the following values:

   - Select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-feedback.jpg"
     alt="Okta feedback"
     className="screenshot"
   />

   Then click **Finish**.

#### Step 3. Send SAML metadata to Apollo

1. From your new SAML integration's details page, scroll down and click **View SAML setup instructions** on the right side:

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-settings.jpg"
     alt="Okta settings"
     className="screenshot"
   />

2. In the dialog that appears, copy and paste the contents of the **IDP metadata** text box into a text file:

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/okta-idp-metadata.jpg"
     alt="Okta IdP metadata"
     className="screenshot"
   />

3. Send the text file to your Apollo contact. They will complete your SSO setup.

### Add Apollo GraphOS as a Bookmark App

Since both legacy Okta integrations only support an [SP-initiated flow](#supported-features), we strongly recommend hiding the application in the Okta catalog for users and instead adding Apollo GraphOS as a **[Bookmark App](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_Bookmark_App.htm)**. Bookmark Apps allow your users to correctly launch the application from the Okta catalog.

To do so, follow [Okta's instructions](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_Bookmark_App.htm) with the following Bookmark Application configurations:

- **Application label**: Apollo GraphOS Enterprise
- **URL**: `https://studio.apollographql.com/login`
