noIndex: true
---

Self-service single sign-on (SSO) is only available for organizations with Dedicated and Enterprise plans who previously set up their SSO using PingOne and need to migrate.
To confirm if you can use self-service SSO, visit [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) and check for an SSO migration banner.

[To-do: Banner screenshot]

If you don't see this banner, you can't use the self-service setup and must use these instructions to set up your SSO:

- [Okta (SAML-based)](../okta-integration-guide/)
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)
  - [SAML-based](../microsoft-entra-id-integration-saml-guide)
  - [OIDC-based](../microsoft-entra-id-integration-oidc-guide)
- [Generic SAML](../saml-integration-guide/)
- [Generic OIDC](../oidc-integration-guide/)
