title: Self-Service SSO Availability
---

Self-service single sign-on (SSO) is currently only available for organizations with Dedicated and Enterprise plans who previously set up their SSO using PingOne and need to migrate.
To confirm if you can use self-service SSO, visit [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) and check for an SSO migration banner.

## Non-self-service setup

If you don't see the migration banner, you can't use the self-service setup and must use these instructions to set up your SSO:

#### SAML-based

- [Okta](../okta-integration-guide/) (SAML-based)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](../microsoft-entra-id-integration-saml-guide) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)
- [Generic SAML](../saml-integration-guide/)

#### OIDC-based

- [Microsoft Entra ID](../microsoft-entra-id-integration-oidc-guide) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)
- [Generic OIDC](../oidc-integration-guide/)
