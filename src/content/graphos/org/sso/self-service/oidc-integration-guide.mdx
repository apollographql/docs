<PremiumFeature>

Self-service single sign-on (SSO) is only available for organizations with Dedicated and Enterprise plans who previously set up their SSO using PingOne and need to migrate.
If you're unsure if you need to migrate please see the [Migration Guide](./migration#who-needs-to-migrate).
If you are setting up SSO for the first time, please refer to [these instructions](../oidc-integration-guide).

</PremiumFeature>

This guide walks through configuring a generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo SSO.
If you use Okta or Microsoft Entra ID as your IdP, instead see the corresponding guide for your IdP:

- [Okta](./oidc-okta)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](./oidc-microsoft-entra-id) (formerly known as Azure Active Directory)

## Prerequisites

Setup requires:

- Administrative access to your IdP
- A GraphOS user account with the [**Org Admin** role](../members/#organization-wide-member-roles)

## Setup

<SSOSetupSteps type="OIDC" idp="application" />

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

### Step 1. Enter your SSO details

<SSOShareDetails type="OIDC" />

### Step 2. Create a custom application

1. Once you reach **Step 2: Configure Your IdP** in the wizard, open your IdP's admin dashboard in a separate browser tab.
2. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **Logo**: [Apollo logo](../../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

3. Retrieve the following values from your SSO provider and enter them in the setup wizard.

- **Client ID**: this should be a specific **Application ID**
- **Client Secret**: a secret value you may need to first create in your IdP
- **Issuer**: the issuer value from a **OpenID Connect metadata document** found in your IdP

### Step 3. Configure OIDC to work with Apollo

1. Verify that the **Sign-in Redirect URL** in your application matches the one shown in the GraphOS wizard.
2. If your IdP permits it, set the following user attributes:

- `sub`: `user.email`
  - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` or `user.mail` provides this unique mapping.
- `email`: Your IdP's email attribute, often something like `user.email`
- `given_name`: Your IdP's first name attribute, often something like `user.firstName`
- `family_name`: Your IdP's last name attribute,often something like `user.lastName`

3. Save this configuration in your IdP and click **Next** in the GraphOS wizard.

### Step 4. Verify SSO Configuration

### Step 5. Enable SSO

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

<SSOLegacyUsers idp="your IdP" appType="application" />

## Assign users in your IdP

Once your SSO setup is live, assign users to your new Apollo GraphOS application in your IdP.
Consult your IdP documentation if necessary.
For help assigning the relevant groups and users, contact your SSO or Identity & Access Management team.
