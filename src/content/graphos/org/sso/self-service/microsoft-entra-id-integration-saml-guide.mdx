<PremiumFeature>

Self-service single sign-on (SSO) is available only for organizations with Dedicated and Enterprise plans who previously set up their SSO using PingOne and need to migrate.
If you're unsure if you need to migrate please see the [Migration Guide](./migration#who-needs-to-migrate).
If you are on a Dedicated or Enterprise plan and setting up SSO for the first time, please refer to [these instructions](../microsoft-entra-id-integration-saml-guide).

</PremiumFeature>

This guide walks through configuring Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) as your GraphOS organization's identity provider (IdP) for SAML-based SSO.

<SSOMigrationNotice />

## Setup

<SAMLSetupSteps idp="Entra ID enterprise application" />

### Prerequisites

Setup requires:

- An Entra ID user account with at least the [Cloud Application Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#cloud-application-administrator) role
- A GraphOS user account with the [**Org Admin** role](../members/#organization-wide-member-roles)

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

### Step 1. Enter your SSO details

<SSOShareDetails type="SAML" />

### Step 2. Create an Entra ID enterprise application

1. Once you reach **Step 2: Your IdP and Apollo** in the wizard, go to your [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/). Alternatively, you can sign in to the [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com/) and then go to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
2. Go to **Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications** and select **+New application** in the top menu.
3. In the top menu, select **+Create your own application**.
4. Enter `Apollo GraphOS` as the name of your app. Below, keep the **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)** option selected. Click **Create**.

     alt="Application creation in Microsoft Entra ID"
     className="screenshot"
     width="450"
   />

5. On the app's **Overview** page, select **2. Set up single sign-on**. You'll assign users and groups later.
6. On the app's **Single sign-on** page, select **SAML** as the single sign-on method.
7. At the top of the **SAML-based Sign-on** page, click **Upload metadata file** and upload the file provided by the GraphOS setup wizard. Alternatively, you can enter these values manually in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section:

   - **Identifier (Entity ID)**: Entity ID value provided by the setup wizard
   - **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**: Single Sign-on URL provided by the setup wizard

   Click **Save**.

8. In **Attributes & Claims**, ensure the following claim **names** have the corresponding **source attributes**:

   - `email`: `user.mail`
   - `given_name`: `user.givenname`
   - `family_name`: `user.surname`
   - `sub`: `user.userprinicipalname`

   Otherwise, manually enter them.

     alt="Application creation in Microsoft Entra ID"
     className="screenshot"
     width="450"
   />

9. Under **SAML Certificates**, copy the **App Federation Metadata URL** into a text file for the next step.

<img
  src="../../img/sso/entra-saml-certificates.jpg"
  alt="Application creation in Microsoft Entra ID"
  className="screenshot"
  width="700"
/>

10. In the setup wizard in GraphOS Studio, select whether your Entra implementation requires signing an AuthnRequest.
11. Click **Continue**..

### Step 3. Share SAML metadata with Apollo

In the setup wizard, enter the **App Federation Metadata URL** you previously copied into the **Upload metadata from URL** field.
Click **Continue**.

### Step 4. Verify details

The GraphOS Studio setup wizard populates your SSO metadata based on the URL you entered in the last step. Verify the values are correct.

You can find them in Entra ID, **Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications**, in the application you created for GraphOS.

- Your application's **Entity ID** is in the **Single sign-on** tab. Scroll down to the **Basic SAML Configuration** section and look for a field labeled **Identifier (Entity ID)**. This field contains the Entity ID. It has the following format: `urn:<unique>.<region>.auth0.com`.
- The **SSO URL** is also in thee **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the **Sign on URL** field.

Once you've verified the values or corrected them, click **Continue**.

### Step 5. Enable SSO

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->

<SSOLegacyUsers idp="Entra ID" appType="enterprise application" />

## Assign users in Entra ID

<SSOEntraIDAssignUsers />

## Legacy setup

<Note>

These steps use PingOne's email invite method, because in some cases Apollo's legacy entity ID (`PingConnect`) might already be used by another application in your organization.

</Note>

#### 1. Create an Azure AD app registration

1. Go to your [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com/) and then navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.
2. In the left pane, select **App Registrations**. Then in the top ribbon click **+ New Registration**.
3. On the **Register an application** page, provide the following information:

   - Provide a friendly name for the PingOne client (such as `Apollo GraphOS` or `PingOneConnect`).
   - Under **Supported account types**, select which Microsoft account types will have access.
   - Leave **Redirect URI** empty. You'll provide this information later.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-app-registration.gif"
     alt="Azure App Registration"
     className="screenshot"
   />

   Then click **Register**.

#### 2. Retrieve your endpoint URL and client ID

1. From the **Overview** section of your newly created app registration, copy and paste your **Application (client) ID** into a local text file.
2. Still in the **Overview** section, select **Endpoints** from the top menu.
3. Copy and paste the **OpenID Connect metadata document** URL into the same local text file:

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-client-id-endpoint.gif"
     alt="Azure endpoint URL and client ID"
     className="screenshot"
   />

#### 3. Create a client secret

1. From the **Certificates & secrets** section of your app registration, click **+ New client secret** and create a new secret.

2. Copy and paste the secret's **Value** field to the same text file you created earlier:

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-client-secret.gif"
     alt="Azure client secret"
     className="screenshot"
   />

#### 4. Configure API permissions

1. From the **API permissions** section of your app registration, check whether `User.Read` is listed by default. If isn't, add it manually:

   1. Select **+ Add a permission > Microsoft Graph > Application permissions**.
   2. Search for `Group`, expand, and select `Group.Read.All`.
   3. **Save** your changes.
   4. If `User.Read` was not auto created, repeat this process for `User.Read`.

2. Also from the **API Permissions** section, select **Grant admin consent** next to the **+ Add a permission** button. Doing this ensures that your users don't need to grant consent during SSO.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-configure-api-permissions.gif"
     alt="Azure configure API permissions"
     className="screenshot"
   />

3. From the **Manifest** section of your app registration, find the `groupMembershipClaims` property. Change its value from `null` to either `All` or `SecurityGroup`.
   - This ensures that the group membership claim is included in the access token during SSO.
4. **Save** your changes.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-manifest.png"
     alt="Azure manifest"
     className="screenshot"
   />

#### 5. Integrate PingOne with Azure AD

1. After you receive your PingOne SSO invitation email, click the enrollment link to create a new account or sign in with an existing account.
2. On the landing page, click **Setup** on the top ribbon.
3. Select **Connect to an Identity Repository > Microsoft Azure AD** and click **Next**.
4. From the **Configure Your Microsoft Azure Connection** modal:

   1. Copy and paste the endpoint URL, client ID, and client secret values saved earlier from Azure AD.
   2. Select **Verify**. PingOne will verify that it can query the endpoint(s) you've specified.
   3. For **Scope**, select the OAuth scopes to include in authentication requests.
   4. Click **Next**.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-pingone-connection.gif"
     alt="Azure PingOne connection"
     className="screenshot"
   />

5. In Step 2 of the wizard, copy the **PingOne Redirect URI** and paste it on the Azure AD app registration.

   - Redirect URIs can be configured from the **Overview** section of your app registration under the **Essentials** menu in Azure AD.
   - Select **Redirect URIs > Add a platform > Web** and enter the Redirect URI you copied from PingOne. Select **Configure** to save changes.
   - Back on the PingOne configuration wizard, select **Next** after copying and pasting the URI.

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-pingone-redirect-uri.gif"
     alt="Azure PingOne redirect URI"
     className="screenshot"
   />

6. In Step 3 of the wizard, configure the **Map Attributes** section by mapping the incoming attributes or claims from Azure AD to PingOne. You can leave this with the default Attribute Mapping.

7. In Step 4 of the wizard, choose whether or not to synchronize your user groups from Azure AD to your PingOne user groups.

   - The permissions `User.Read` and `Group.Read.All` are required for synchronization to be successful.
   - Any PingOne user groups that do not exist in your Azure provider will be replaced by the Azure groups.
   - Each of your Azure group members are automatically added to the corresponding PingOne groups when the user initially signs on (SSO) to PingOne. This is PingOne's just-in-time user provisioning.

8. Click **Save** to finish connecting Azure AD to PingOne.

#### 6. Configure the OIDC application

After you successfully configure the identity bridge between Azure AD and PingOne, you need to configure and enable Apollo as an OIDC application. The configuration for this application should already be initialized, and you can access it via the **Complete your Application Configuration** reminder under **Applications** in the PingOne admin console.

1. Select **Meteor Development Group - GraphOS Studio** under **Complete your Application Configuration**.

   <Note>

   If the **Add OIDC Application** wizard doesn't automatically pop-up, select the **SAML** tab and then select the **OIDC** tab.

   </Note>

   <img
     src="../../img/sso/azure-oidc-application.gif"
     alt="PingOne OIDC application"
     className="screenshot"
   />

2. In Step 1 of the **Add OIDC Application** wizard, configure the application name, description, category, and icon (optional).
3. Click **Next** for Steps 2-5 (these are configured by default).
4. In Step 6 of the wizard (**Attribute Mapping**), you must map `email` to `email` and `sub` to `preferred_username`. You can optionally map more attributes for given name, family name, and others.
5. In Step 7 of the wizard (**Group Access**), select whichever groups should receive SSO access to Apollo.
6. Click **Done** to complete the configuration.

#### 7. Notify Apollo

After you complete the steps above, reach out to your Apollo contact. They will complete your SSO setup.
