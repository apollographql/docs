<SSOPremiumFeature />

This guide walks through configuring a generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo SSO.
If you use Microsoft Entra ID as your IdP, instead see [the Entra OIDC guide](./microsoft-entra-id-integration-oidc-guide/).

# Setup

OIDC-based SSO setup has these steps:

1. Share your SSO details with Apollo in GraphOS Studio.
1. Create an app registration for Apollo GraphOS in your IdP.
1. Configure API permissions in your IdP.
1. Enable SSO in GraphOS Studio.

### Prerequisites

Setup requires:

- Administrative access to your IdP
- A GraphOS user account with the [**Org Admin** role](../members/#organization-wide-member-roles)

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = NO -->

### Step 1. Share your SSO details

### Step 2. Create a custom application

1. Once you reach **Step 2: Your IdP and Apollo** in the wizard, open your IdP's admin dashboard in a separate browser tab.
2. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

3. Retrieve the following values from your SSO provider and enter them in the setup wizard.

- **Client ID**: this should be a specific **Application ID**
- **Client Secret**: a secret value you may need to first create in your IdP
- **Issuer**: the issuer value from a **OpenID Connect metadata document** found in your IdP

### Step 3. Configure OIDC to work with Apollo

If your IdP permits it, set the following user attributes:

- `sub`: `user.email`
  - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` or `user.mail` provides this unique mapping.
- `email`: Your IdP's email attribute, often something like `user.email`
- `given_name`: Your IdP's first name attribute, often something like `user.firstName`
- `family_name`: Your IdP's last name attribute,often something like `user.lastName`

### Step 4. Enable SSO

<!-- vale Apollo.Headings = YES -->
