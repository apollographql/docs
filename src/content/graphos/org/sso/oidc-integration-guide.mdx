This guide walks through configuring a generic OpenID Connect (OIDC) based identity provider (IdP) for use with Apollo SSO.

# Setup

SSO setup has two main steps:

1. Create a custom Apollo GraphOS application in your IdP.
2. Send your application's OIDC metadata to Apollo.

These steps generally require administrative access to your IdP.

### Step 1. Create a custom application

1. Send a request to your Apollo contact to configure an OIDC SSO integration. Include the organization name(s) you are setting up SSO for, as well as the email domains you want to associate with the organization. Your Apollo contact will respond with the following:

   - A one-time use URL with configuration details including:
     - Client ID
     - Client Secret
     - Audience identifier
     - Optionally, the discovery URL of your OIDC service
   - The OIDC redirect URL of the integration
   - A link to a form where you can submit your SSO information to Apollo

   <Note>

   SSO metadata values differ for each GraphOS organization. If setting up SSO for multiple organizations, repeat the following steps for each organization using different values.

   </Note>

2. Create a new application in your SSO environment. While doing so, set the following values:

   - **App Name**: `Apollo GraphOS`
   - **App logo**: [Apollo logo](../../img/sso/apollo-sk-logo.png) (optional)

3. Set the following claims within the ID token returned from your IdP:

   - `sub`: `user.email`
     - The `sub` attribute should uniquely identify any particular user to GraphOS. In most cases, `user.email` provides this unique mapping.
   - `email`: `user.email`
   - `given_name`: `user.firstName`
   - `family_name`: `user.lastName`

4. Save your configuration.

5. Assign users to your new Apollo GraphOS application. For help assigning the relevant groups and users, contact your SSO or Identity & Access Management team.

### Step 2. Send OIDC metadata to Apollo

To complete the configuration, complete the Apollo-provided link from step 1 with the appropriate information and inform your Apollo contact. They will then be able to enable SSO.

Once your SSO configuration is live, organization members must re-login to GraphOS Studio. Once you've confirmed the new configuration works as expected, remove any legacy Apollo GraphOS applications in your IdP if they exist.
