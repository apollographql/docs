title: Managing organization members
---

A GraphOS organization can have any number of members, and each member can be assigned a **role** that defines their capabilities within the organization.

## Organization-wide member roles

Each organization member has one of the following roles:

Intended for developers who are considered admins to the graph.                                                                                                                                            |                        Enterprise only                         |

Only members with the **Org Admin** role can assign roles to other members. You can see which role you have in a particular organization from your [user settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings), or from the organization's Members tab.

## Graph-specific member roles

You can override a member's organization-wide role for individual graphs. For example, if a member has the **Observer** role in your organization, you can assign them the **Contributor** role for a graph that they need extra access to.

> A member's graph-specific role must have _more_ permissions than their organization-wide role.

Members with the **Graph Admin** or **Org Admin** role can assign graph-specific roles from the Access tab of the graph's Settings page.

If a graph is made [hidden](../graphs/studio-features/#internal-graph-visibility-enterprise-only), then only users with explicit overrides (as well as **Org Admin**s) can see the graph.

The **Graph Admin** and **Org Admin** roles have exactly the same permissions for a particular graph, so you can only grant a **Graph Admin** override, not an (equivalent) **Org Admin** override.

When **Contributor**s in an organization create a new graph, they are automatically granted the **Graph Admin** role for that graph.

> Currently, graph usage metrics and traces are not displayed to **Consumer**s via the Studio web app, but they are not blocked at the API layer. We intend to remove this capability from **Consumer**s, but for the time being you should understand that **Consumer**s are not fully prevented from accessing these metrics and traces.

### Billing managers

Members with the **Billing Manager** role can't see or manage graphs in their organizations, but they can:

- Remove members from the organization
- View and edit billing information (including changing the billing plan)
- Manage organization configuration (name, avatar, etc.)

Notably, **Billing Manager**s can't invite new members to the organization or update roles.

## Graph API key roles

Each [graph API key](../api-keys/) also has a corresponding member role. This role can be any of **Graph Admin** (the default), **Contributor**, **Documenter**, **Observer**, or **Consumer**. A graph API key provides access only to its associated graph. It does not provide access to actions associated with organizations or users.

Otherwise, a graph API key is equivalent in privileges to a user with the same role for the graph. For example, you can use a **Consumer** key to fetch a graph's schema, and you can use a **Graph Admin** key to manage integrations.

A few operations aren't listed in the table above because they are _only_ supported by graph API keys, not personal API keys for users in the graph's organization. These are primarily operations that are performed by your GraphQL server, such as usage reporting (traces and performance metrics).

> Before January 2021, graph keys did not have roles. Keys created before that date (shown as **Legacy Admin** keys) can perform the following operations:
>
> - Create new variants
> - Run schema checks
> - View and manage graph API keys
> - Push schemas to a graph
> - See the schemas of subgraphs in federated graphs
> - View graph schemas and changelogs
> - Modify schema checks configuration

## Inviting members

**Org Admin**s can invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). Organization admins can also create a persistent **invite link** from the organization's Settings tab, which can be used to invite any number of members. Using either method, an org admin can specify which role a new member receives.

> **Do not share invite links publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If an invite link becomes compromised, an admin can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Both **Org Admin**s and **Billing Manager**s can remove members from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com).
