<EnterpriseFeature linkWithAnchor="https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#security" />

Organizations with a GraphOS Enterprise plan can export and download an audit log of all material events that have occurred in the organization over a given timeframe.

The interface for requesting an export of auditable events is available under the **Audit** tab of your organization's homepage in GraphOS Studio:

<Note>

Audit log data is available from July 2021 onward.

</Note>

## Creating an audit log export

<Note>

Only [Organization Admins](./members/#organization-wide-member-roles) can request audit exports.

</Note>

When creating an audit log export, you specify a **time range**, along with optional filters to limit actions to a particular **user** or **graph**. The maximum time range that you can request audits for is 180 days, as defined by Apollo's [retention policy](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#data-retention).

<Note>

If you need to export a log with more complex filters and against archives, please email support@apollographql.com.

</Note>

Exports sometimes take a few minutes to process. When an export is ready, Studio emails you a link to its CSV file, and you can also find that link in the audit exports table. Audit export files are available to download for 30 days.

Note that it takes about 10 to 15 minutes before a performed action can appear in an exported audit log.

## Reading an audit log

An exported audit log is a CSV file in which each row represents a material change to your Studio organization. Columns contain the following information:
