title: Publishing schemas to GraphOS
description: Using the Rover CLI

import RegisterCli from '../../shared/register-cli.mdx';

Whenever you make changes to a graph's schema, you should **publish** those changes to Apollo GraphOS using the Rover CLI. Doing so ensures that Apollo always has an up-to-date understanding of your graph.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you haven't installed Rover yet:**
> 1.  <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started/" target="_blank">Install the Rover CLI.</a>
> 2. <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/configuring/" target="_blank">Authenticate Rover</a> with Apollo Studio.

## Subgraph schemas

Every supergraph in Apollo Studio includes one or more subgraphs. You _individually_ publish each subgraph's schema to Apollo with `rover subgraph publish`:

```bash
rover subgraph publish --schema ./products.graphql --name products docs-example-graph@current
```

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph " "
  subgraphA[Products<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphC[Inventory<br/>subgraph];
  end
  graphos{{GraphOS}};
  subgraphA & subgraphB & subgraphC -. rover subgraph publish  .-> graphos;
  class graphos secondary;
```

**To publish a subgraph schema to Apollo:**

1. Identify the name of the subgraph you're publishing to. You can view the names of your existing subgraphs from your variant's **Subgraphs** page in Studio.

2. **If you're publishing a subgraph for the first time,** _also_ obtain the **routing URL** for that subgraph. This is the URL that your router will use to communicate with the subgraph.
    - If Studio already knows your subgraph's routing URL, you don't need to provide this value unless you're changing it.

2. Run the `rover subgraph publish` command and provide it your subgraph's schema in one of the ways shown:

    ```bash
    # Provide a local .graphql file path
    rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name locations --routing-url https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ --schema ./schema.graphql

    # Provide an introspection result via stdin
    rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name locations --routing-url https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ --schema -
    ```

Whenever you publish a subgraph schema, GraphOS attempts to **compose** all latest versions of your subgraph schemas into a single **supergraph schema** for your router:

```mermaid
graph TB;
  serviceA[Subgraph<br/>schema<br/>A];
  serviceB[Subgraph<br/>schema<br/>B];
  serviceC[Subgraph<br/>schema<br/>C];
  composition[["üõ†<br/>Composition "]];
  supergraph{{"Supergraph schema<br/>(A + B + C + routing machinery)"}};
  serviceA & serviceB & serviceC --> composition;
  composition -- "(Composition succeeds)" --> supergraph;
  class composition tertiary;
```

If this composition succeeds, your router is updated with the result. This enables clients to query any newly added fields, and it _prevents_ them from querying any _removed_ fields.

> You can manually fetch your router's latest supergraph schema with the `rover supergraph fetch` command, or retrieve it from your supergraph's **Schema > SDL** page in Apollo Studio.

## Publishing with continuous delivery

To get the most out of GraphOS, you should **publish each update to any production schema as soon as it occurs**. Consequently, schema publishing should be part of your continuous delivery pipeline.

Here's a sample continuous delivery configuration for schema publishing in CircleCI:

```yaml
version: 2

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:8

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run: npm install

      - run:
          name: Install Rover
          # highlight-start
          command: |
            # Download and install Rover
            # This is pinned to a specific version for predictability in CI
            curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/v0.8.1 | sh

            # This allows the PATH changes to persist to the next `run` step
            echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.rover/bin:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
          # highlight-end

      # Start the GraphQL server.  If a different command is used to
      # start the server, use it in place of `npm start` here.
      - run:
          name: Starting server
          command: npm start
          background: true

      # make sure the server has enough time to start up before running
      # commands against it
      - run: sleep 5

      # highlight-start
      # When running on the 'main' branch, push the latest version
      # of the schema to Apollo Studio.
      - run: |
          if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "main" ]; then
            rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant \
              --schema ./schema.graphql \
              --name locations
          fi
      # highlight-end
```
