<Note>

This page only applies to Serverless cloud routers created before May 21, 2024. Serverless cloud routers created on or after this date automatically run on AWS.

</Note>

Serverless is switching cloud providers from Fly.io to AWS to improve reliability and performance.
Serverless cloud routers created before May 21, 2024, run on Fly.io infrastructure, and you must migrate them in GraphOS Studio.

Cloud routers on Fly.io will continue to operate until July 2, 2024. After this date, any cloud routers on Fly.io will be permanently deleted.

## What's changing?

Running Serverless cloud routers on AWS offers improved reliability. On AWS, Serverless cloud routers support larger schemas and offer a consistent ten requests per second (RPS) of throughput.

Running on AWS also increases performance. On Fly.io, cloud routers were hosted in Chicago. On AWS, they will be hosted in us-east-1. This means faster performance, particularly for customers running subgraph servers on AWS, especially if they are in or near us-east-1.

With improved reliability and performance, Serverless can offer additional GraphOS router features. Refer to the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router) for the full list of supported features.

If you need more than 10 RPS throughput or hosting in a different AWS region, consider upgrading to Dedicated.

### Inactivity period changes

On Fly.io, Serverless cloud routers sleep after two minutes of inactivity. Sleeping routers can't serve requests and must wake up to do so. On AWS, cloud routers sleep after seven days of inactivity.

After an additional 30 days of inactivity, Apollo deletes Serverless cloud routers.
Deletion preserves a cloud router's associated variant's schema but deletes the underlying cloud router. Learn more in [Serverless router status](./#serverless-router-status).

|                                        | Fly.io Hosted | AWS Hosted |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Inactivity period <br/>before sleep    | Two minutes   | Seven days |
| Inactivity period <br/>before deletion | 60 days       | 37 days    |

## Who needs to migrate?

Only GraphOS Serverless plan customers using Fly.io hosted cloud router need to migrate. You can check if your cloud router runs on Fly.io by checking its region on the **Overview** page in GraphOS Studio. If the region is **ord - Chicago**, you need to migrate.

Don't hesitate to contact [cloud@apollographql.com](mailto:cloud@apollographql.com) with any migration questions or concerns.

## How to migrate

Migrating to AWS entails creating a new variant or graph in GraphOS Studio. Once you create a new variant or graph, you receive a new graph ref and endpoint URL to redirect client traffic to. You can't reuse an existing graph ref.

<Caution>

Only delete your existing cloud router after you've created your new cloud router.

### Step 1. Create a new graph

To get started, create a new graph or variant in GraphOS Studio. You need at least one subgraph during this process. See the [getting started](/graphos/quickstart/cloud/#from-an-existing-account) for details on creating a new graph.

Creating a new graph or variant generates a new graph ref and endpoint URL. You need to update these values wherever you use them. This includes the graph ref in your Rover commands and endpoint URL in your client codebase.

### Step 2. Add subgraphs

If you have multiple subgraphs, [add each subgraph](/graphos/quickstart/next-steps/#add-another-subgraph) to your new variant.

### Step 3. Setup router configuration

Copy and paste your old router's configuration into your new one. You can access a Serverless cloud router configuration in GraphOS Studio under **Settings > Cloud Router > Router configuration YAML**.

Router configuration defines important values like CORS policies and header propagation.

<Note>

If you have [secrets](../configuration/#managing-secrets) in your old cloud router config, you must also set them in your new one. Secrets can't be read once saved.

</Note>

### Step 4. Test

After you've added all your subgraphs and set up your cloud router config, try running a few sample operations from [Explorer](../../explorer/).
You may need to enable [subgraph errors](/graphos/cloud-routing/configuration#subgraph-error-inclusion) to troubleshoot if your operations don't execute.

Simulate production traffic before going live. With extremely complex schemas or operations, Serverless on AWS may offer less throughput than Fly.io. If you exceed throughput limits, your clients will receive 429 errors.

<Note>

It isn't possible to increase throughput on Serverless. Consider upgrading to [Dedicated](../dedicated/).

</Note>

### Step 5. Go live

To go live, update the endpoint URL your clients use to query your supergraph. You can see your new router's endpoint from the **Overview** page of your variant.
