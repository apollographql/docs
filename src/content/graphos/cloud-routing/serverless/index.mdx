<Note>

Serverless is moving to AWS. If you initialized your serverless cloud before May 21, 2024, you may need to take steps to migrate. [Learn more](./aws-migration).

</Note>

GraphOS Serverless cloud routers run on shared infrastructure that Apollo manages. Serverless is designed for demos, proof-of-concepts, and small-scale production apps that don't require more than ten requests per second (RPS).

## Serverless compute limitations

Serverless capacity can be exhausted in the following circumstances:

- Complex schemas can exceed available machine memory for Serverless cloud routers. For example, Serverless cloud routers don't support schemas with over 1,000 input types.
- Too many simultaneous requests can cause your Serverless cloud router to return `429` errors to your clients.

Because Serverless has limited underlying compute resources, certain workloads might require you to upgrade to Dedicated. <TrackableLink href="https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales?type=dedicated&referrer=docs" eventName="content_contact_cloud">Contact Sales</TrackableLink> for a free trial.

## Automatic deletion of unused cloud routers

Apollo automatically deletes variants of Serverless cloud supergraphs that receive zero requests over 30 consecutive days.

- Apollo will notify you via email whenever a Serverless variant is approaching this 30-day limit.
- To prevent deletion, execute at least one GraphQL operation on the variant's router before the 30-day limit.

## Serverless router status

In addition to **Initializing**, **Running**, and **Error** [statuses](../#cloud-router-status) which all cloud routers can have, Serverless cloud routers have these additional statuses:

| Status                         | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Running, will sleep soon**   | Your cloud router hasn't received requests for six days and is scheduled to go to sleep soon.                                                     |
| **Sleeping**                   | Your cloud router hasn't received requests for seven days and is now sleeping. [Learn more.](#sleeping)                                           |
| **Waking**                     | Your cloud router was asleep and recently received requests. You may experience API downtime for approximately one minute and up to five minutes. |
| **Sleeping, will delete soon** | Your cloud router has been asleep for almost 30 days and will be deleted soon.                                                                    |
| **Deleted**                    | Your cloud router has been deleted but the associated graph variant remains. You can recreate a cloud router at anytime. [Learn more.](#deleted)  |

### Sleeping

Serverless cloud routers that haven't received requests for seven days automatically go to sleep. While sleeping, your cloud router can't serve requests.

Sleeping cloud routers automatically wake up once they receive requests. While waking, your cloud router can't process incoming requests. It typically takes about one minute to wake up.

### Deleted

If a cloud router has been sleeping for 30 days, Apollo automatically deletes it. Deleted routers can't serve requests.
Router deletion doesn't delete the associated graph variant from GraphOS Studio, but it does spin down the infrastructure powering your cloud router.

You can access a deleted router's variant's schema but you can't recover the [router configuration](../configuration) or any [secrets that were stored in GraphOS Studio](../configuration/#managing-secrets). The variant's metrics are only retained for a day after deletion per the [Serverless data retention policy](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#data-retention).
