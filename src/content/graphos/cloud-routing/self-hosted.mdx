title: Self-hosted routing in GraphOS
description: Host your supergraph's router in your own infrastructure

> ⚠️ **Important:** If you're just getting started with GraphOS, we recommend instead [creating a cloud supergraph](../getting-started/).
>
> Self-hosted supergraphs are recommended only for organizations that need to host their router in their own infrastructure, usually to satisfy advanced performance or compliance requirements.

> If you _do_ need to host your supergraph's router in your own infrastructure, you might also benefit from the expanded features of an [Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/). Please [contact us](https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales/).

Some organizations with advanced requirements need to host every part of their supergraph in their own infrastructure, _including_ the supergraph's router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Locations<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

A supergraph with this structure is called a [self-hosted supergraph](../org/graphs/#self-hosted-supergraphs). Here are some reasons why your organization might need to use self-hosted routing instead of [cloud routing](./overview/) (where Apollo hosts your router for you):

- **Compliance.** All of your supergraph's components must be hosted in a particular region to adhere to compliance requirements.
- **Performance.** You need to minimize latency between your router and subgraphs by enabling them to communicate _without_ traversing the public internet (e.g., by hosting all components in a VPC).
- **Customization.** You need to configure your router's behavior beyond what's currently possible with [cloud routing](./configuration/).

With the exception of Apollo-managed routing, self-hosted supergraphs benefit from all of the same GraphOS features as cloud supergraphs (metrics reporting, schema checks, the Explorer, and so on).

## Creating a self-hosted supergraph

Organizations with any Apollo plan can create self-hosted supergraphs. To learn how, see the [self-hosted quickstart](../self-hosted/).
