<DedicatedPreview />

To interact with your supergraph, clients send requests to your router's endpoint. The _custom domains_ feature lets you replace the default `apollographos.net` router endpoint URL with your own subdomain.

Custom domains can help to:

- Minimize client-side changes
- Use your existing CORS policies and security controls
- Protect your cloud routers from DDoS attacks
- Provide TLS termination to your cloud routers

## How custom domains work

Custom domains use [CNAME records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/) to point requests made to your subdomain to your `apollographos.net` router endpoint URL. Custom domains run on [Cloudflare's](https://www.cloudflare.com/) global network.

## Custom domains setup

Setup includes two steps:

1. Setting up a CNAME record in your DNS provider.
2. Opening a ticket with Apollo support to enable your CNAME.

<Note>

Custom domains will be available through self-service in GraphOS Studio later in 2024. In the meantime, you must open a support request to enable your CNAME with Apollo.

</Note>

### Setup a CNAME

Create a CNAME record in your DNS provider that points to your Dedicated variant's [existing subdomain](./quickstart#router-endpoint-url). For example, create a CNAME for `api.mydomain.com` that points to `current--docs-example.apollographos.net`.

You can find your Dedicated variant's subdomain in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) on the **Cloud Router** page under **API Endpoint**.

<Note>

CNAME records are assigned at the variant level, so you must set up a separate CNAME record for each graph variant that requires a custom domain.

</Note>

### Using an existing CNAME

If you already have a CNAME record for the custom domain you want to use, [contact Apollo Support](#open-a-support-ticket) before making any changes. We'll guide you through remapping from a different host to the GraphOS Cloud subdomain.

### Open a support ticket

Next, open a support ticket requesting Apollo to enable your new CNAME.
You can open a ticket by clicking the **?** icon in the top right of [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) and selecting **Contact Support**.

Your request may take up to two business days to process. Apollo will notify you when your new CNAME is live.

## Limitations

The custom domains feature doesn't support the following:

- [Apex records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records#record-names) or [A records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records#record-types)
- Multiple custom domains per variant
- Load balancing traffic across multiple variants
