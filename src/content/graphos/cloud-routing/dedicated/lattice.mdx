```

This guide shows how to create Lattice services and share them with the Apollo AWS organization that hosts cloud routers.

You can provision VPC Lattice with the [Apollo Terraform module](https://github.com/apollographql/terraform-graphos-aws). Refer to the [module's README](https://github.com/apollographql/terraform-graphos-aws#apollo-graphos-cloud-private-subgraphs-module) for more information.

<Note>

- You can only use Lattice for subgraphs in the same AWS region as your cloud router. If you need to run subgraphs in different AWS regions or run your workloads in a region not yet supported by Cloud Dedicated, please <TrackableLink href="https://www.apollographql.com/contact-sales?type=dedicated&referrer=docs" eventName="content_contact_cloud">let us know</TrackableLink>.
- Using Amazon VPC Lattice incurs costs outside of your Cloud Dedicated spend. Refer to the [Lattice pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/lattice/pricing/) to learn more.

</Note>

## Overview

To allow Cloud Dedicated to send traffic to your private subgraphs, you must:

1. Create one or more Amazon VPC Lattice target groups.
2. Create one or more Amazon VPC Lattice services.
3. Share the service(s) with the Apollo AWS Organization.
4. Provide the service(s) routing information in your Apollo Organization configuration page.

This guide offers step-by-step instructions for each stage.

<Note>

The AWS Console interface may differ slightly from the screenshots in this guide.

</Note>

## Step 1. Create Amazon VPC Lattice target groups

A Lattice _target group_ is a collection of targets, or compute resources, that run your application or service. You must set these up so your Lattice services can route requests accurately. Check out the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/target-groups.html) to learn more.

1. In the AWS Console for your region of choice, go to the VPC service page:

- [US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1)
- [Europe (Ireland) - eu-west-1](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=eu-west-1)

2. In the menu on the left, scroll down and open **VPC Lattice > Target groups**.

  <img

    alt="Amazon VPC service page left menu"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/vpc-lattice-menu.jpg"
    width="175px"
  />

3. Click **Create target group** on the top right.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/create-target-group.jpg"
  />

4. In the **Basic configuration** section, set the properties that match your subgraph resources.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/target-group-configuration.jpg"
  />

5. (Optional) If you use a target type with health checks, ensure you configure your health checks correctly, or Lattice will not be able to send traffic to your subgraphs.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/target-group-health-checks.jpg"
  />

6. Register the targets based on your chosen target type.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/register-targets.jpg"
  />

7. Review your targets to make sure all information is correct.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/review-targets.jpg"
  />

8. Click **Create target group** at the bottom right corner of the page.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/create-target-group-final.jpg"
  />

Congratulations! You've created an Amazon VPC Lattice target group. Repeat this process for each resource you want to share with Cloud Dedicated.

## Step 2. Create an Amazon VPC Lattice service

1. In the AWS Console for your region, go to the VPC service page:

- [US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1)
- [Europe (Ireland) - eu-west-1](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=eu-west-1)

2. In the menu on the left, scroll down and open **VPC Lattice > Services**.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page left menu"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/vpc-lattice-menu.jpg"
    width="175px"
  />

3. Click **Create service** in the top right.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/create-service.jpg"
  />

4. In the **Identifiers** section, enter the name, description, and tags the service.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/service-identifiers.jpg"
  />

5. In the **Custom domain configuration** section, leave the **Specify a custom domain configuration** checkbox unchecked.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/custom-domain.jpg"
  />

6. In the **Service access** section, select the **AWS IAM** authentication type and paste the following authorization policy. This policy ensures that only the AWS Organization for Cloud Dedicated can send traffic to your subgraphs.

  ```json showLineNumbers=false
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": "*",
        "Action": "vpc-lattice-svcs:Invoke",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
          "ForAnyValue:StringLike": {
            "aws:PrincipalOrgPaths": "o-9vaxczew6u/*/ou-leyb-l9pccq2t/ou-leyb-fvqz35yo/*"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

7. (Optional) For extra security, you can audit all the traffic coming to your subgraph by enabling **Access logs** in the **Monitoring** section.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/service-monitoring.jpg"
  />

8. Once you've configured the service, click **Next** on the bottom right of the page.

9. Define routing information to your target groups. Set the protocol to **HTTPS** and the port to **443**.

  <Note>

  For security reasons, we require you to use HTTPS for your listener. This enforces encryption in transit of the traffic between your GraphOS cloud router and your Lattice listener.

  </Note>

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/http-listener.jpg"
  />

10. If you have multiple target groups, add a rule for each subgraph.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/service-rules.jpg"
  />

11. Click **Next** at the bottom right of the page once you've configured your listener.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/listener-complete.jpg"
/>

12. Do NOT select a VPC Lattice service network. Your subgraphs will integrate with a service network managed by Apollo. Instead, click the **Next** button at the bottom right of the page.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/service-network.jpg"
  />

13. Ensure the information you've entered is correct, then click **Create VPC Lattice service** at the bottom right of the page.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/create-service-final.jpg"
  />

Congratulations! You've now created a Lattice service for your subgraphs.

## Step 3. Share the Amazon VPC Lattice service with Cloud Dedicated

1. In the AWS Console for your region of choice, go to the Resource Access Manager service page:

- [US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home?region=us-east-1)
- [Europe (Ireland) - eu-west-1](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home?region=eu-west-1)

2. In the menu on the left, scroll down and open **Shared by me > Resource shares**.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page left menu"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/vpc-lattice-shared-by-me.jpg"
    width="175px"
  />

3. Click **Create resource share** in the top right corner.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/create-resource-share.jpg"
  />

4. In the **Resource share name** section, enter a name for your resource share.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/resource-share-name.jpg"
  />

5. In the **Resources section**, select the **VPC Lattice Services** resource type.
6. Select all the Lattice services that contain your subgraphs.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/resource-selection.jpg"
  />

7. (Optional) Set tags for your resource share.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/resource-tags.jpg"
  />

8. Click the **Next** button at the bottom right corner of the page.
9. Verify that the managed permissions give access to associate the Lattice services with a service network (`vpc-lattice:CreateServiceNetworkServiceAssociation and vpc-lattice:GetService`). Then click the **Next** button at the bottom right of the page.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/managed-permissions.jpg"
  />

10. In the **Principals** section, select **Allow sharing with anyone** with a principal type of **AWS account**, enter the following value for the account ID: `282421723282`, then click the **Add** button.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/resource-principal.jpg"
  />

11. Confirm that `282421723282` is the only selected principal for this resource share, then click the **Next** button on the bottom right corner.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC shared resources page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/resource-principal-confirmation.jpg"
  />

12. Confirm that all the information is correct, then click **Create resource share** at the bottom right of the page.

Congratulations! You've now shared your Lattice services with Cloud Dedicated.

The last step is associating your resource share with the Apollo Organization account.

<Note>

- You have 12 hours to associate your resource share—otherwise, AWS Resource Access Manager will fail to process the invitation, and you will have to restart this step.
- For security purposes, we recommend you continue to the next step immediately after creating the resource share. If you see that the resource share was **Accepted** or **Failed** in the AWS console and you did not follow step 4 of this guide, follow the steps to [remove access to private subgraphs](#removing-access-to-private-subgraphs) and restart this step.

</Note>

## Step 4. Associate your resource share with your Apollo Organization

1. In the AWS Console for your region of choice, go to the Resource Access Manager service page:

- [US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home?region=us-east-1)
- [Europe (Ireland) - eu-west-1](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home?region=eu-west-1)

2. In the menu on the left, scroll down and open **Shared by me > Resource shares**.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC service page left menu"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/shared-by-me.jpg"
  />

3. Click the resource share you created in the previous step.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC resource share page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/select-resource-share.jpg"
  />

4. Copy the **ARN** for the resource share.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Amazon VPC resource share page"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/resource-share-summary.jpg"
  />

The next steps differ based on whether this is [your first private subgraph](#setup-for-new-private-subgraphs) or if you're adding this [service to an existing graph](#setup-for-existing-graphs).

### Setup for new private subgraphs

1. Go to [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content).
2. Click the **Create New Graph** tab at the top right of the screen.
3. Follow Studio's onboarding steps to create a graph with a new private subgraph.
4. When prompted to **Provide your GraphQL API endpoint**, select **My endpoint is not directly accessible** at the bottom of the page.
5. Choose the backend provider you want to use for your private subgraph and the region where your subgraph should be provisioned.

  <Note>
  
  All private subgraphs connected to a GraphOS cloud router must be in the same region.

  </Note>

6. Paste the ARN of the resource share you created and copied from your AWS Console, then click **Link my Resource** and **Next** to continue.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Linking a Lattice resource"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/link-lattice-resource.jpg"
    width="500"
/>

7. From the dropdown menu, select the Lattice service that you would like to connect to your GraphOS router. A default path of `/api/graphql` is automatically added to the URL. You can change this path if you want to.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Selecting a private Lattice service"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/select-private-service.jpg"
    width="500"
/>

8. Add a **Service Name** to describe your Lattice service. This name will be used to identify your Lattice service in GraphOS Studio.
9. Paste the GraphQL schema for this subgraph in the **Schema** field. You can also upload a schema file by clicking the **Upload Schema** button.

<ExpansionPanel title="Why do I need to provide a GraphQL Schema?">

When your AWS resource is set to private, it isn't accessible by external services by default. This ensures a high level of security for your data, but it also means extra steps are needed to enable communication between your resource and our system. We need to know the schema of your GraphQL API so that we can generate the correct queries and mutations to send to your subgraph.

</ExpansionPanel>

10. Update the ID and the name of the supergraph that you want to add this private subgraph to. An ID and name are automatically generated based on your organization's name, but you can change both as needed.
11. To finish, click **Create GraphOS Router**.

Congratulations! You've now created a GraphOS cloud router with a private subgraph.

### Setup for existing graphs

1. Go to the graph you want to connect in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content).
2. From the left sidebar, open the **Subgraphs** tab of your graph.
3. Click **Add a Subgraph** on the right of the page.
4. In the dialog, select the **Private** option, then select the AWS service you want to add from the dropdown menu. A default path of `/api/graphql` is automatically added to the URL. You can change this path if you like.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Selecting a private service from existing services"
    src="../../img/cloud-dedicated/select-private-service.jpg"
    width="500"
/>

5. Add a **Service Name** to describe your Lattice service. This name will be used to identify your Lattice service in GraphOS Studio.

6. Paste the GraphQL schema for this subgraph in the **Schema** field. You can also upload a schema file by clicking the **Upload Schema** button.

<ExpansionPanel title="Why do I need to provide a GraphQL Schema?">

When your AWS resource is set to private, it isn't accessible by external services by default.

</ExpansionPanel>

7. To finish, click **Add Subgraph**.

Congratulations! You've now added a private subgraph to your GraphOS cloud router.

## Next steps

After you've shared your VPC lattice services with Apollo's AWS organization, you may want to set up monitoring to validate that traffic is flowing. Refer to the [Lattice management page](./lattice-management) for more information on this, how to further restrict access to subgraphs, and remove resource shares.

If you're running into issues with your Lattice setup, see the [troubleshooting guide](./lattice-troubleshooting).
