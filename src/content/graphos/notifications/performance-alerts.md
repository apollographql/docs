title: Performance alerts from Apollo Studio
---

> Performance alerts require a [paid plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/). They are currently experimental.

Apollo Studio can notify your team's Slack workspace or Pagerduty instance whenever a particular metric (such as error rate) for a particular GraphQL operation exceeds a defined threshold. This is useful for detecting anomalies, especially following a release.

## Supported metrics

You can configure performance alerts to trigger for any of the following metrics:

- **Request rate:** requests per minute
- **Request duration:** p50/p95/p99 service time
- **Error rate:** errors per minute
- **Error percentage:** the number of requests with errors, divided by total
  requests

Each performance alert you define can apply to either **a specific operation** or **any operation**. If you define an alert that applies to a specific operation, the "any operation" alerts for the _same metric_ no longer apply to that operation (i.e., the more specific alert takes precedence).

## Setup

1. Go to your graph's Settings page in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/).
2. Select the **Reporting** tab.
3. Find the Performance Alerts card and click **Add a new alert**.

4. Configure the alert's **Operation Name**, **Trigger**, and **Trigger Value** to suit your needs.
5. Select a **Channel** to send alerts to. You can select **New Channel** from the dropdown if you haven't yet configured the Slack channel or Pagerduty instance you want to use.
6. Click **Create**.

## Threshold window

Thresholds are measured against a rolling five-minute window. For example, let's say you configure an alert to trigger when an operation's error rate exceeds 5%. If 6 out of 100 executions of that operation result in an error during a five-minute period, the alert will trigger with an error rate of 6%. When the error rate falls back below 5%, your notification will resolve.
