title: Operation metrics in GraphOS
description: Understand your operation performance
---

Once you've configured your graph to send [operation metrics to GraphOS](./sending-operation-metrics/), you can view them in GraphOS Studio. In addition, you can configure your subgraphs to include [resolver-level traces](#resolver-level-traces) in their responses to your router, which are then also reported to GraphOS.

## Operations overview

The **Insights** page gives you a helpful overview of your supergraph's recent usage and performance, including:

- The rate of requests sent to your router
- Your supergraph's p95 service time
- Your supergraph's error rate

The overview displays _overall_ values for these metrics, along with values broken down by operation name. You can click an operation name to view more detailed information for it.

- Filter by time period and client

## Resolver-level traces

If you [enable trace reporting](#enabling-traces) in your subgraphs, GraphOS Studio can also display resolver-level trace information about each operation:

/>

Shown above, the **Traces** tab for an operation provides a breakdown of timing and error information for _each field_ that's resolved as part of that operation. This helps you identify opportunities to improve your supergraph's overall performance by optimizing whichever resolvers currently act as a bottleneck.

### Enabling traces

To enable federated trace reporting in your subgraphs, consult the documentation for the GraphQL server library your subgraph uses.

> **Not all subgraph-compatible libraries support federated trace reporting.**
>
> To confirm the support status for your library, check its **FEDERATED TRACING** entry in [Federation-compatible subgraph implementations](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs).

If your subgraphs use [Apollo Server with the `@apollo/subgraph` library](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-subgraph-setup/), federated trace reporting is enabled by default. You can customize Apollo Server's trace reporting behavior with the [inline trace plugin](/apollo-server/api/plugin/inline-trace).
