description: Learn how to monitor and optimize your GraphQL usage and performance with raw metrics, insights, and alerts with Apollo GraphOS.

GraphOS Studio offers a performant and intuitive UI to help you monitor and understand your supergraph's usage and performance.

## Metrics collection and forwarding

To analyze operation metrics in GraphOS Studio, you must first report them to GraphOS. If you have a [cloud supergraph](../quickstart/cloud), its router automatically reports operation metrics.

If you have a [self-hosted supergraph](../quickstart/self-hosted), you need to [connect your router to GraphOS](./sending-operation-metrics) to report metrics. The reporting mechanism is the same if you use [Apollo Server](/apollo-server/) without the Apollo Router. If you're using a third-party server, you need to [set up a reporting agent](./sending-operation-metrics#from-a-third-party-server-advanced).

Apollo also offers a [Datadog integration](./datadog-integration) to forward your graph's performance metrics to your Datadog account.

<EnterpriseFeature>

The following require an [Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/):

<br />

- Connecting a self-hosted router to GraphOS
- Forwarding metrics to Datadog

<br />

Reporting metrics from [Apollo Server](/apollo-server) or a [monograph](../graphs/#monographs)
requires an [Enterprise or legacy Team plan](../org/plans).

## Insights and analysis

Once you've configured your graph to send operation and field metrics to GraphOS, you can examine them from any variant's **Insights** page:

  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"
  width="700"
/>

The Insights page offers:

- A collapsible left sidebar that acts as a paginated index of your graph's operations and fields, where you can search, filter, and sort operations and fields
- An operations overview where you can adjust the overview's timeframe and filter it to specific clients
- Individual and overall operations performance metrics, including request rate and latency
- [Resolver-level traces](./operations#resolver-level-traces), if you've configured them
- Field usage metrics

Refer to the [Operations metrics](./operations) and [Field usage](./field-usage) pages to learn more about these metrics and how you can use them to optimize your graph's performance.

## Notifications and alerts

Beyond actively monitoring the Insights page, you can also configure GraphOS to notify your team about changes to your graph and its performance. Check out [Setting up GraphOS notifications](./notifications/notification-setup) to learn more.
