title: Operation metrics in GraphOS
description: Understand your supergraph's performance
---

If you have a [cloud supergraph](../graphs/#cloud-supergraphs), its router _automatically_ reports metrics for the operations that clients run on it.

> For other types of graphs, see [Sending operation metrics to GraphOS](./sending-operation-metrics/).

In addition, you can configure your subgraphs to include [resolver-level traces](#resolver-level-traces) in their responses to your router, which are then also reported to GraphOS.

## Viewing metrics

You can visualize operation metrics in Apollo Studio, from any variant's **Operations** page:

<img
  src="../img/studio-metrics.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Apollo Studio metrics view"
/>

This page gives you a helpful overview of your supergraph's recent performance, including:

- The rate of requests sent to your router
- Your supergraph's p95 service time
- Your supergraph's error rate

The page displays _overall_ values for these metrics, along with values broken down by operation name. You can click an operation name to view more detailed information for it.

## Resolver-level traces

If you [enable trace reporting](#enabling-traces) in your subgraphs, Apollo Studio can also display resolver-level trace information about each operation:

<img
  src="../img/traces-tab.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Traces tab for an operation in Apollo Studio"
  width="600"
/>

Shown above, the **Traces** tab for an operation provides a breakdown of timing and error information for _each field_ that's resolved as part of that operation. This helps you identify opportunities to improve your supergraph's overall performance by optimizing whichever resolvers currently act as a bottleneck.

### Enabling traces

To enable federated trace reporting in your subgraphs, consult the documentation for the GraphQL server library your subgraph uses.

> **Not all subgraph-compatible libraries support federated trace reporting.**
>
> To confirm the support status for your library, check its **FEDERATED TRACING** entry in [Federation-compatible subgraph implementations](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs).

If your subgraphs use [Apollo Server with the `@apollo/subgraph` library](/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-subgraph-setup/), federated trace reporting is enabled by default. You can customize Apollo Server's trace reporting behavior with the [inline trace plugin](/apollo-server/api/plugin/inline-trace).
