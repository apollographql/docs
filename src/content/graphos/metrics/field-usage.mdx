<Note>

The retention period for field usage metrics depends on your [plan](../org/plans).
Refer to the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#data-retention) for details.

</Note>

You can analyze the [field metrics sent by your graph](./sending-operation-metrics/#reporting-field-usage) to GraphOS from any variant's **Insights** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content):

  alt="The Insights page in GraphOS Studio"
/>

The Insights page presents operation and field metrics. It has two main sections:

- The collapsible left sidebar, where you can search, filter, and sort operations and fields
- The main insights view, which displays [overall operations metrics](./operations#operation-metrics) by default, or field information and usage metrics for a single field once you select it from the left sidebar

This guide focuses on field metrics and information. Refer to [Operation metrics in GraphOS](./operations) for more information on the other metrics on this page, including [resolver-level traces](./operations#resolver-level-traces).

## Field details

When you click a field name, you open detailed information for that field in the main insights view. This includes when the field first and last received traffic, any applied [tags](../graphs/federated-graphs/#schema-tagging), and the subgraphs that provide the field.

Below that, you can view the field definitions within your subgraph schema.

/>

Next, you see which clients and operations contribute to the field's usage. Each row in the **Clients & Operations** table shows a client that requested the field, the number of operations that used the field the client made, and the total number of requests the client made. Selecting a client shows more details about the operations that requested and executed the field.

Below Clients & Operations, you can view visualizations for the field's request rate, latency distribution, and error metrics.

### Field requests and executions

Each row in the **Clients & Operations** table displays some combination of the following metrics for each field, depending on which data you report to GraphOS:

| Metric              | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client versions     | How many different client versions have sent the operation                                                                          |
| Requests            | How many operations sent by clients over a given time period included the field, according to [metrics provided by your servers](./sending-operation-metrics#reporting-field-usage-metrics) |
| Executions          | How many times your servers have executed the resolver for the field over a given time period                                       |

For each of these columns to appear on the Insights page, your GraphQL servers must [report the associated metrics to GraphOS](./sending-operation-metrics#reporting-field-usage). If some but not all your GraphQL servers report this data, the Insights page presents an incomplete picture of your graph's field usage.

Take a look at the **Requests** and **Executions** for an example field:

  class="screenshot"

  width="700"
/>

As you can see, they can differ significantly. There are many possible reasons for this, described below.

#### Objects in lists

Let's say a client executes the following query one time:

```graphql
query GetBooks {
  books {
    title
  }
}
```

If `Query.books` returns a list of ten `Book` objects, then `Book.title` is resolved ten times. This query, therefore contributes just one request but ten executions to the `Book.title` field.

#### Multiple references to a field

Let's say a client executes the following query one time:

```graphql
query GetTwoBooks {
  firstBook: book(id: "123") {
    title
  }
  secondBook: book(id: "345") {
    title
  }
}
```

This operation includes two references to the fields `Query.book` and `Book.title`. Therefore, the resolvers for these fields each execute twice (assuming `Query.book` doesn't return `null`). However, these multiple references are all part of a single operation.

Therefore, this query contributes just one request but two executions for each of the `Query.book` and `Book.title` fields.

#### Fields that return interfaces

Let's say our GraphQL server's schema defines the following interface and object types:

```graphql
interface Media {
  title: String!
}

type Book implements Media {
  title: String!
  author: String!
}

type Query {
  favoriteMedia: Media!
}
```

Now, let's say a client executes the following query:

```graphql
query GetFavoriteMedia {
  favoriteMedia {
    title
  }
}
```

If `Query.favoriteMedia` returns a `Book` object here, then `Book.title` is resolved one time. However, the original query does not reference `Book.title`. Instead, it references `Media.title`, because `Query.favoriteMedia` has a return type of `Media`.

Therefore, this query contributes zero requests and one execution for `Book.title`. It also contributes one request for `Media.title`. Note that interface fields always have zero executions.

#### Requested fields that aren't resolved

Let's say a client executes the following query one time:

```graphql
query GetLoggedInUser {
  loggedInUser {
    name
  }
}
```

Now, let's say `Query.loggedInUser` returns `null` because no user is logged in. In this case, the resolver for `User.name` never executes, because its parent returns `null`. Therefore, this query contributes one request and zero executions for `User.name`.

A requested field might not be resolved for any of these reasons:

- The field is nested under a field that returns `null`, as shown above.
- The field is nested under a field that returns a list, but the list is empty.
- The field is part of a fragment that doesn't apply to a particular object.
- The resolver is skipped due to a `@skip` or `@include` directive.

#### `@key` and `@requires` fields in a federated graph

<Note>

This case applies only to graphs that use [Apollo Federation](/federation).

</Note>

Let's say our federated graph includes these two subgraph schemas:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

```graphql title="Reviews subgraph"
extend type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID! @external
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  score: Int!
  product: Product!
}

type Query {
  reviews: [Review!]!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

Now, let's say a client executes the following query:

```graphql
query GetAllReviews {
  reviews {
    score
    product {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This query's execution starts in the Reviews subgraph, but it needs to obtain each `Product`'s `name` from the Products subgraph. As part of this process, the Products subgraph must [resolve references](/federation/entities/#2-define-a-reference-resolver) to `Product`s provided by the Reviews subgraph.

To help resolve these references, the Reviews subgraph must return each `Product`'s `id` field, even though that field isn't included in the original query. This is because `id` is a `@key` field for `Product`.

Therefore, this query contributes zero requests and one execution for `Product.id`. Similar logic applies to fields that use the [`@requires` directive](/federation/entities-advanced#contributing-computed-entity-fields).
