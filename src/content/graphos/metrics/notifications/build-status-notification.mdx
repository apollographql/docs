<PreviewFeature />

Configure GraphOS to send notifications to a webhook whenever GraphOS attempts to build a new supergraph schema for your federated graph.
Notifications indicate whether the build succeeded. Successful build notifications include a temporary URL to the new supergraph schema.

## Setup

<CreateNotification notificationType="Build Status" />

## Configure webhook

<ConfigureWebhookNotification />

### Webhook format

Custom webhook notification details are provided as a JSON object in the request body.

The JSON object conforms to the structure of the `ResponseShape` interface:

```javascript
interface BuildError {
  message: string;
  locations: ReadonlyArray<Location>;
}

interface Location {
  line: number;
  column: number;
}

interface ResponseShape {
  eventType: 'BUILD_PUBLISH_EVENT';
  eventID: string;
  supergraphSchemaURL: string | undefined;
  buildSucceeded: boolean;
  buildErrors: BuildError[] | undefined;
  graphID: string;
  variantID: string;
  timestamp: string;
}
```
