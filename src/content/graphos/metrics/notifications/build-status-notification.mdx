<PreviewFeature />

Configure GraphOS to send notifications to a custom webhook whenever GraphOS attempts to build a new supergraph schema for your federated graph.
Notifications indicate whether the build succeeded. Succecssful build notifications include a temporary URL to the new supergraph schema if so.

## Setup

<CreateNotification />

## Configuring a new channel

<ConfigureWebhookNotification />

## Webhook format

Custom webhook notification details are provided as a JSON object in the request body.

The JSON object conforms to the structure of the `ResponseShape` interface:

```javascript
interface BuildError {
  message: string;
  locations: ReadonlyArray<Location>;
}

interface Location {
  line: number;
  column: number;
}

interface ResponseShape {
  eventType: 'BUILD_PUBLISH_EVENT';
  eventID: string;
  supergraphSchemaURL: string | undefined; // See description below
  buildSucceeded: boolean;
  buildErrors: BuildError[] | undefined; // See description below
  graphID: string;
  variantID: string; // See description below
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 Date string
}
```

- If the build succeeds, the value of `supergraphSchemaURL` is a short-lived (24-hour) URL that enables you to fetch the supergraph schema without authenticating (such as with an API key). Otherwise, this field is not present.

- If the build fails, `buildErrors` is an array of `BuildError` objects that describe the errors that occurred during the build. Otherwise, this field is not present.

- The value of `variantID` is in the format `graphID@variantName` (for example, `mygraph@staging`). This format is known as a [graph ref](/rover/conventions/#graph-refs).
