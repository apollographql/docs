## Setup

<Note>

If you want to receive notifications via both Slack and webhook, you need to repeat these setup steps for both.

<CreateNotification />

## Configuring a new channel

You can send schema notifications via Slack, custom webhook, or both.

### Slack

<ConfigureSlackNotification />

### Webhook

<ConfigureWebhookNotification />

## Webhook format

Custom webhook notification details are provided as a JSON object in the request body.

The JSON object conforms to the structure of the `ResponseShape` interface:

```javascript
interface Change {
  description: string;
}

interface ResponseShape {
  eventType: 'SCHEMA_PUBLISH'; // Currently, only SCHEMA_PUBLISH webhooks are supported
  eventID: string;
  changes: Change[]; // Set of schema changes that occurred
  schemaURL: string; // See description below
  schemaURLExpiresAt: string; // ISO 8601 Date string
  graphID: string;
  variantID: string; // See description below
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 Date string
}
```

- The value of `schemaURL` is a short-lived (24-hour) URL that enables you to fetch the published schema without authenticating (such as with an API key). The URL expires at the time indicated by `schemaURLExpiresAt`.

- The value of `variantID` is in the format `graphID@variantName` (for example, `mygraph@staging`).
