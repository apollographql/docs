GraphOS can notify your team about changes to your graph and its performance.
These notifications help you stay up-to-date and address issues as they arise.

## Notification types

GraphOS supports the following notification types:

- [Daily reports](./daily-reports) of your graph's request rate, error rate, and latency
- [Performance alerts](./performance-alerts) whenever metrics like error percentage or request latency exceed a threshold
- [Schema change notifications](./schema-change-integration) whenever your graph's schema is updated
- [Schema proposal notifications](./schema-proposal-integration) whenever a schema proposal is created or revised, or if its status changes
- [Build status notifications](./build-status-notification) whenever GraphOS attempts to compose a supergraph schema

Refer to notification type pages for setup instructions.
