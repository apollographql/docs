GraphOS can notify your team about changes to your graph and its performance. These notifications help you stay up to date and address issues as they arise.

<Tip>

If you don't have a GraphOS organization yet, [get started here](../../quickstart/cloud/).

## Notification types

GraphOS supports the following notification types:

- [Daily reports](./daily-reports) of your graph's request rate, error rate, and latency
- [Performance alerts](./performance-alerts) whenever a metric such as error percentage or request latency exceeds a particular threshold (this experimental feature requires a [paid plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/))
- [Schema change notifications](./schema-change-integration) whenever your graph's schema is updated
- [Schema proposal notifications](./schema-proposal-integration) whenever a schema proposal is created or revised, or if its status changes
- [Build status notifications](./build-status-notification) whenever Apollo attempts to compose a supergraph schema for your federated graph (this preview feature is [enterprise only](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/))

Refer to the specific notification type page for setup instructions.
