subtitle: Receive alerts when a schema proposal is created or revised
description: Set up Apollo GraphOS notifications for GraphQL schema proposals. Receive real-time alerts whenever schema proposals are created or revised, or if their status changes.
---

<EnterpriseFeature>

Schema proposals are only available with a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing?referrer=docs-content).

</EnterpriseFeature>

Configure GraphOS to send notifications to a webhook whenever schema proposals are created or revised or if their status changes.
These webhooks are useful for automating workflows. For example, your organization may want to open a draft pull request in your codebase whenever a proposal's status changes to **Approved**.

## Setup

1. Go to your graph's **Settings** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content).
1. Open the **Reporting** tab.
2. Click **Add notification** in the upper right.
3. Select **Schema proposal** and click **Next**.
4. Select the schema proposal event(s) you want to receive notifications for:

   - **Proposal creation**
   - **Proposal revision**
   - **Proposal status change**

5. Select either an existing webhook notification channel or to create a new one. If creating a new one, configure the webhook as described in the next section.

## Configure webhook

<ConfigureWebhookNotification notificationType="Proposal" />

### Webhook format

Custom webhook notification details are provided as a JSON object in the request body.
To avoid including sensitive information, payloads contain IDs—for example, proposal ID and revision ID—rather than objects containing details about the proposal or revision.
You can use the [Platform API](/graphos/platform-api/) to fetch full objects using the IDs in the webhook payload.

The JSON object conforms to the structure of the `ResponseShape` interface:

```javascript
enum ProposalStatus {
  OPEN
  DRAFT
  IMPLEMENTED
  APPROVED
}

interface ResponseShape {
  "eventType": string;
  "eventID": string;
  "graphID": string;
  "variantID": string;
  "proposalID": string;
  "change": {
    "status": ProposalStatus | undefined
    "previousStatus": ProposalStatus | undefined
    "revisionId": string | undefined
  },
  "timestamp": string;
}
```
