<EnterpriseFeature>

Schema proposals are only available with a [GraphOS Enterprise plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing?referrer=docs-content).

<PreviewFeature>

This feature is in invite-only [preview](/resources/product-launch-stages#preview). Please get in touch with your Apollo contact if you'd like to request access.

Configure GraphOS to send notifications to a webhook whenever schema proposals are created or revised or if their status changes.
These webhooks are useful for automating workflows. For example, your organization may want to open a draft pull request in your codebase whenever a proposal's status changes to **Approved**.

## Setup

1. Go to your graph's **Settings** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content).
1. Open the **Reporting** tab.
2. Click **Add notification** in the upper right.
3. Select **Schema proposal** and click **Next**.
4. Select the schema proposal event(s) you want to receive notifications for:

   - **Proposal creation**
   - **Proposal revision**
   - **Proposal status change**

5. Select either an existing webhook notification channel or to create a new one. If creating a new one, configure the webhook as described in the next section.

## Configure webhook

Custom webhooks require you to set up an HTTPS endpoint accessible via the public internet. GraphOS sends webhook notifications to this endpoint as `POST` requests. Notification details are provided as JSON in the request body, as described in the next section.

1. Specify a name for this notification channel in the **Channel Name** field. This name must be unique among all your graph's notification channels, including Slack channels.
2. In the **Webhook URL** input, provide the URL of your HTTP(S) endpoint.
3. Optionally, enter a **Secret Token**.

  If you enter a token, each notification HTTP request includes an `x-apollo-signature` header whose value is a [Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) generated using the token, the request body as the message, and the SHA256 hash function. The `x-apollo-signature` header has the format `sha256=hmac-value`.

  <ExpansionPanel title="See an example">

  Given the following inputs:

  **Secret token** (key): `your_secret_token`

  **Request body** (message):
  ```
  {"eventType":"APOLLO_PROPOSAL_STATUS_CHANGE","eventId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000","graphId":"graphId","variantId":"p-1","proposalId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000","change":{"status":"OPEN","previousStatus":"DRAFT"},"timestamp":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+0000"}
  ```

  **Hash function**: SHA256

  The `x-apollo-header` value would be `sha256=0400670a3ea155eb9f602a60e7897e72515e1a4b04fe06a786e631cc32a1307e`.

4. Click **Next** and complete any remaining steps in the dialog.

### Webhook format

Custom webhook notification details are provided as a JSON object in the request body.
To avoid including sensitive information, payloads contain IDs—for example, proposal ID and revision ID—rather than objects containing details about the proposal or revision.
You can use the [Platform API](/graphos/platform-api/) to fetch full objects using the IDs in the webhook payload.

The JSON object conforms to the structure of the `ResponseShape` interface:

```javascript
enum ProposalStatus {
  OPEN
  DRAFT
  IMPLEMENTED
  APPROVED
}

interface ResponseShape {
  "eventType": string;
  "eventID": string;
  "graphID": string;
  "variantID": string;
  "proposalID": string;
  "change": {
    "status": ProposalStatus | undefined
    "previousStatus": ProposalStatus | undefined
    "revisionId": string | undefined
  },
  "timestamp": string;
}
```
