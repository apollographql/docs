title: Schema proposals notifications
subtitle: Receive alerts when a schema proposal is created or revised
description: Set up Apollo GraphOS notifications for GraphQL schema proposals. Receive real-time alerts whenever schema proposals are created or revised, or if their status changes.
---

Configure GraphOS to send notifications to a custom webhook whenever schema proposals are created or revised, or if their status changes.

## Setup

<CreateNotification />

## Configuring a new channel

<ConfigureWebhookNotification />

## Webhook format

Custom webhook notification details are provided as a JSON object in the request body.

The JSON object conforms to the structure of the `ResponseShape` interface:

```javascript
interface Change {
  description: string;
}

interface ResponseShape {
  eventType: 'SCHEMA_PUBLISH';
  eventID: string;
  graphID: string;
  variantID: string; // See description below
  proposalID: string; // See description below
  timestamp: string; // ISO 8601 Date string
}
```

- The value of `variantID` is in the format `graphID@variantName` (for example, `mygraph@staging`).
