description: Set up notifications for your GraphQL graph's performance, schema changes, and more. Stay updated and address issues effectively using custom alerts.

GraphOS can notify your team about changes to your graph and its performance. These notifications help you stay up to date and address issues as they arise.

<Tip>

If you don't have a GraphOS organization yet, [get started here](../../quickstart/cloud/).

## Supported notifications and channels

GraphOS can send your team the following notification types:

- [Daily reports](./daily-reports) of your graph's request rate, error rate, and latency
- [Performance alerts](./performance-alerts) whenever a metric such as error percentage or request latency exceeds a particular threshold (this experimental feature requires a [paid plan](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/))
- [Schema change notifications](./schema-change-integration) whenever your graph's schema is updated
- [Schema proposal notifications](./schema-proposal-integration) whenever a schema proposal is created or revised, or if its status changes
- [Build status notifications](./build-status-notification) whenever Apollo attempts to compose a supergraph schema for your federated graph (this preview feature is [enterprise only](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/))

GraphOS can send each of these notification types to the channel(s) indicated:
