## Acting on report data

The daily report provides an actionable summary of what's happened in your API over the last 24 hours. Here's how you can use it to identify issues:

- The **request rate** shows how many queries hit your server each minute. It also shows the most popular operations. If you see a significant dip in this value, it might mean that queries can't reach your server or that a particular client is down.
- An operation's **p95 service time** indicates that 95% of that operation's executions complete faster than the reported value. You can use this to identify that your API is overloaded and users are seeing long loading delays or to find out which queries take the longest to run. This metric is often connected to UI performance, so a 500 ms query probably means some part of your UI takes that long to display.
- The **error percentage** shows how many of your GraphQL requests produce an error. It also shows a list of the operations with the highest error percentage. Spikes in errors might be the result of an underlying backend malfunction.

For more about these metrics, refer to the [operation metrics page](../../metrics/operations#operation-metrics).
