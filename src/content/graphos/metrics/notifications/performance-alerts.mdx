<ExperimentalFeature />

GraphOS can alert your team's Slack workspace or PagerDuty when a metric, like error rate, for a GraphQL operation goes over a set threshold.
These alerts are useful for detecting anomalies, especially following a release.

## Supported metrics

You can configure performance alerts for any of the following metrics:

- **Request rate:** requests per minute
- **Request duration:** p50/p95/p99 service time
- **Error rate:** errors per minute
- **Error percentage:** the number of requests with errors divided by the total requests

Each performance alert you define can apply to either a specific operation or any operation.
If you define an alert that applies to a specific operation, the "any operation" alerts for the same metric no longer apply to that operation.
That is, the more specific alert takes precedence.

## Setup

<Note>

If you want to receive notifications via both Slack and PagerDuty, repeat these setup steps for both.

</Note>

1. Go to your graph's Settings page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content).
2. Select the **Reporting** tab.
3. Find the **Performance Alerts** card and click **Add a new alert**.
4. Configure the alert's **Operation Name**, **Trigger**, and **Trigger Value** to suit your needs.
5. Select a **Channel** to send alerts to. You can select **New Channel** from the dropdown if you haven't yet configured the Slack channel or PagerDuty instance you want to use.
6. Click **Create**.

## Configure a new channel

### Slack

<ConfigureSlackNotification />

### PagerDuty

<ConfigurePagerDutyNotification />

## Threshold window

Thresholds are measured against a rolling five-minute window.
For example, let's say you configure an alert to trigger when an operation's error rate exceeds 5%.
If 6 out of 100 executions of that operation result in an error during a five-minute period, the alert will trigger with an error rate of 6%.
When the error rate falls back below 5%, your alert will resolve.
