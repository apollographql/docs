The **Performance** pillar focuses on improving your supergraph's runtime performance and efficiency.
A well-architected supergraph platform not only delivers a great end-user experience.
It also provides ways for its developers to proactively improve both real and perceived performance.
Additionally, it gives developers the documentation and tools they need to ship and measure those changes effectively.

## Principles

### Enable client developers to improve perceived end-user latency

Improving perceived end-user latency is crucial for organizations that rely on digital services.
Slow loading times can cause high bounce rates and lower conversion rates, hurting revenue.
Developers can use the following techniques to improve perceived end-user latency:

- Using response compression
- Prioritizing data with `@defer`
- Using subscription/real-time GraphQL features

Providing graph consumers with field-level latency information can also help them make informed choices about operation shapes.
Configuring trace sampling and using persisted queries can also help reduce request sizes and latency.
By using these techniques, organizations can improve their user experience and ultimately increase their bottom line.

### Enable subgraph developers to improve graph performance

Subgraph developers can also help improve the overall performance of the supergraph by optimizing their subgraph's performance.
Techniques include:

- Leveraging caching to improve the performance of operations and resolvers
- Using dataloaders in resolvers
- Implementing Automatic Persisted Queries (APQs) to improve subgraph request latency

By optimizing their subgraphs, developers can reduce the load on the supergraph and improve its performance.

### Find opportunities to improve performance

Observability tools can be helpful in identifying opportunities to improve the supergraph's performance.
Resolver execution metrics and distributed traces can help developers can understand and optimize the performance of individual components.
Additionally, operation traces can help identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies across the system.
By leveraging these observability tools, teams can proactively identify and address performance issues before they impact end-users.
