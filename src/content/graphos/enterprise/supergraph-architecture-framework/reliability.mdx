title: Reliability
description: Efficiently operate, monitor, and manage your supergraph
---

The **Reliability** pillar is focused on ensuring that your graph is observable, appropriately resourced and scaled,
resilient to change, monitored, and generally production ready. The best practices in this pillar lay a foundation to
build confidence that your supergraph will be available for your consumers and a trusted source of data in your organization.

## Principles

### Understand graph usage

Understanding which clients are using which fields and how their operations use upstream resources is crucial for ensuring the reliability of a system. All of the practices under this principle help us better understand how our system is being used in practice and allow us to make informed decisions about how to optimize and improve reliability.

### Enable effective testing in the supergraph

To enable contributors to effectively test their changes in the supergraph, it is important to provide clear guidance on testing best practices for both subgraphs and entity resolvers. End-to-end testing of the supergraph is also crucial for ensuring reliability, so providing clear instructions on how to test changes to entity resolvers and other components of the supergraph can help contributors catch potential issues before they can impact users.

### Use compute resources efficiently

When using Apollo Router and subgraph services, it's important to balance performance with efficiency. By monitoring pod metrics alongside graph execution metrics, you can identify areas for optimization and ensure that your system is performing efficiently.

### Catch problems before they go into production

One of the best ways to avoid production outages is to catch potential problems early in the development lifecycle. By doing so, you can catch issues before they make it into production and ensure that your system is reliable and stable. Taking these proactive measures can save you time and resources in the long run and help you avoid costly downtime and unhappy customers.

### Identify issues in production

Lowering mean-time-to-recover (MTTR) in your supergraph is crucial for maintaining the reliability of your system. By proactively monitoring and addressing issues, you can minimize the impact of downtime on your users and ensure that your system is always available and performing as expected.

### Prevent issues in production

When it comes to preventing production outages, making the right infrastructure and process choices is key. It's important to consider any potential issues that could arise and take steps to prevent them. This may involve performing risk assessments, conducting regular audits, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. By taking a proactive approach to infrastructure and process choices, teams can minimize the risk of production outages and ensure that their systems remain reliable and available.
