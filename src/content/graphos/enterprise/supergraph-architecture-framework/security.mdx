description: Protect your data and infrastructure with a defense-in-depth approach

The **Security** pillar focuses on ways you can make sure your API is secure, even while using the new paradigms of GraphQL, and how they can operate with your existing organization's standards. Traditional HTTP-based tools often lack support for GraphQL, which makes it even more critical to use an enterprise-grade GraphQL Platform like Apollo GraphOS to run your supergraph.

## Principles

### Apply a defense-in-depth approach to protecting the graph and data

To effectively protect a GraphQL API, it is important to combine a variety of approaches. Utilizing existing security implementations, such as enforcing authentication and authorization in both the graph and upstream systems, is a good starting point. However, it is also crucial to prevent data leakage at the "front door" with tools like Apollo Router. By combining these approaches, you can create a defense-in-depth strategy that maximizes security and ensures the protection of your graph and data.

### Protect the supergraph infrastructure

It is important to avoid unintended changes to your supergraph or allowing access to data via open subgraphs. This can be achieved by following best practices such as assigning and reviewing GraphOS roles and permissions,locking down publishing to production variants, and limiting subgraph access to only the graph router. By implementing these measures, you can ensure that your supergraph infrastructure remains secure and protected from unauthorized access or modifications.

### Prevent data leakage within the supergraph

The supergraph is a central place where data of all different types and quantity flows through. By limiting the exposure and the data returned, you can prevent potential attackers from gaining access to sensitive information. We also want to ensure that we are using standard API best practices to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities. Specific to GraphQL the schema itself can provide insights to malicious actors what your API surface area covers. By implementing these best practices you can help ensure the security of your supergraph and prevent data leaks.

### Protect upstream resources in the supergraph

Enterprise supergraphs will connect clients to many different APIs and with all those connections, the risk for unintentional service impacts increase. API teams that previously may have not had to think about the dangers of exposing their data to other outside their team or organization, may not have though about the amount of traffic volume they need to handle. We also want to prevent any accident from propagating to impacting other services connected to the supergraph. Using tools like operation safelisting, circuit breakers, and rate limiting can make sure our resources are given the chance to handle expected usage of their API.
