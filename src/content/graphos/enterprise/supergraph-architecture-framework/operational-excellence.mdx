description: Efficiently operate, monitor, and manage your supergraph

The **Operational Excellence** pillar focuses on how you best enable your subgraph teams and stewardship teams to build a better supergraph. The best practices covered under this pillar outline how to enable you to build an effective governance program and help organizations build GraphQL schemas in an effective way, helping build trust in the graph from both clients and subgraph authors alike.

## Principles

### Design an effective GraphQL schema

GraphQL schemas are the cornerstone of GraphQL—it enables both frontend and backend teams to understand the data that is available to be sent, and how clients request the data they care about. It’s important that schemas are built well to avoid developer frustration, so the best practices here cover how to best design your schemas.

### Structure the organization to support best practices

As organizations grow their federated graph, scaling issues may arise as a result of the multitude of teams contributing to it. Whether it’s related to schema design evolution or graph ownership, these issues create friction and affect developer velocity negatively. The best practices in this principle cover how to enable graph stewardship teams to be effective, and how organizations should think about the supergraph as a product, rather than a shared service.

### Scale the supergraph

Federating a GraphQL service is a relatively new concept for many organizations, and it’s important to have teams understand how to implement and scale effectively. The best practices in this principle help organizations understand how supergraphs should be built and maintained to ensure it is a successful tool for building new experiences quickly.

### Enforce subgraph standards and best practices

Just as stewardship is important, helping enforce standards is critical to ensure that the resulting supergraph schema is consistent for consuming applications. The best practices in this principle demonstrate how to effectively enforce standards to assist with the creation of a consistent, usable, and standardized supergraph schema.

### Improve supergraph health over time

A supergraph is not a singular creation time, and instead, as with GraphQL as a whole, is intended to be grown over time. Subgraph teams should be thinking about not only how they build today, but how they may need to build in the future and how that affects consuming teams. The best practices covered under this principle help teams build effective processes and tools to understand the health of their supergraph.
