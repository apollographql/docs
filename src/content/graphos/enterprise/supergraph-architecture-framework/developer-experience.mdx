description: Enable subgraph and client developers to evolve and leverage the graph
---

The **Developer Experience** pillar focuses on enhancing developer productivity and satisfaction.
It promotes collaboration via streamlined workflows and effective schema management.
This pillar sets the stage for a platform that's both user-friendly and cutting-edgeâ€”ensuring developers can contribute efficiently.

## Principles

### Keep teams up to date with schema changes

Both graph developers and consumers need to stay up-to-date with your graph's schema.
Automating notifications streamlines communication, ensuring everyone stays informed without relying on manual updates.
This reduces the risk of errors and improves efficiency.
It allows teams across the stack to adapt their workflows to accommodate the changes.

Additionally, automated notifications facilitate stakeholder awareness.
This means stakeholders can provide feedback or raise concerns, fostering a more collaborative and transparent development process.

### Enable subgraph developers

To enhance overall developer efficiency, it's vital to reduce time-to-market for supergraph contributors.
These best practices can help:

- Offer clear documentation outlining workflows for common failure scenarios like publish failures or failed schema checks.
- Validate subgraph schemas during development to catch errors early, and ensure errors are surfaced for quick debugging.
- Implement a standard continuous integration and delivery system to streamline deployment, cutting down the time needed to launch a supergraph.

By following these practices, supergraph contributors can iterate and innovate faster.

### Enable client developers

Improving client application development velocity is key to staying competitive.
To achieve this, client developers need access to three things: accurate documentation, testing best practices, and uniform tooling for code generation.

### Use the supergraph to improve distributed systems

It's essential for any organization using GraphQL Federation to embrace best practices for microservices and distributed systems.
These best practices include:

- Documenting a framework for splitting responsibilities across subgraphs and entity resolvers
- Using federation appropriately for cross-domain orchestration

By following these practices, developers can improve the efficiency of their systems.

### Onboard graph consumers and contributors

Effective onboarding for new developers is foundational for maximizing developer efficiency and productivity.
This is crucial in supergraph development, given the complexity of the technology involved.
By investing in onboarding processes and tools, organizations can expedite the learning curve for new developers.
This ultimately leads to faster development cycles and more efficient use of resources.
