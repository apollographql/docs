## Error types

Whenever GraphOS attempts to create or update your contract schema, it might encounter an error. Errors are identified by the step in the creation process where they occurred:

| Error                                      | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ADD_DIRECTIVE_DEFINITIONS_IF_NOT_PRESENT` | An error occurred adding directive definitions for `@tag`, `@inaccessible`, and core directive usages.                             |
| `DIRECTIVE_DEFINITION_LOCATION_AUGMENTING` | An error occured augmenting the directive definition for `@tag` to support `OBJECT`, `FIELD_DEFINITION`, `INTERFACE`, and `UNION`. |
| `EMPTY_OBJECT_AND_INTERFACE_MASKING`       | All of an object or interface type's fields were excluded, and an error occurred while excluding the entire type.                  |
| `EMPTY_UNION_MASKING`                      | All of a union type's included types were excluded, and an error occurred while excluding the entire union.                        |
| `INPUT_VALIDATION`                         | The contract is attempting to include and exclude the same tag.                                                                    |
| `PARSING`                                  | After including and excluding fields, the resulting contract schema failed to parse.                                               |
| `PARSING_TAG_DIRECTIVES`                   | GraphOS encountered an error while trying to obtain all uses of `@tag` from the source variant schema.                             |
| `PARTIAL_INTERFACE_MASKING`                | An interface field's return type was excluded, and an error occurred while excluding that interface field.                         |
| `SCHEMA_RETRIEVAL`                         | GraphOS encountered an error while retrieving the source variant's schema. It might not yet have a valid composed schema.          |
| `TAG_INHERITING`                           | GraphOS encountered an error while attempting to add parent tags to fields.                                                        |
| `TAG_MATCHING`                             | GraphOS encountered an error determining which types and fields should be inaccessible based on their tags.                        |
| `TO_API_SCHEMA`                            | GraphOS encountered an error while attempting to generate an API schema from the contract variant's supergraph schema.             |
| `TO_FILTER_SCHEMA`                         | GraphOS failed to generate and return a contract supergraph schema for an unknown reason.                                          |
| `UNKNOWN`                                  | An unknown error occurred.                                                                                                         |
| `UNREACHABLE_TYPE_MASKING`                 | GraphOS encountered an error while attempting to exclude unreachable types in the resulting contract schema.                       |
| `VERSION_CHECK`                            | The Federation version used is not supported by contracts.                                                                         |

## Rules for `@tag`s and contracts

### Valid `@tag` locations

**In both Federation 1 and Federation 2,** you can apply tags to the following to filter your contract schema:

- Definitions of object, interface, and union types
- Fields of object types (Federation 1 doesn't support tagging fields of interface types)
  - In Federation 1, you can still make an interface field inaccessible by tagging the interface definition, or by ensuring that object fields that implement the interface field are removed.

**In Federation 2 only,** you can _also_ apply tags to the following:

- Fields of interface types
- Enum types and their values
- Input types and their fields
- Definitions of custom scalar types
- Arguments of fields, **but not directive arguments at this time**

### Valid `@tag` names

- Tag names can include alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), along with hyphen (`-`) and forward slash (`/`).
- Each tag name cannot exceed 128 characters.

```graphql {3}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @tag(name: "a/b/c/1-2-3")
}
```

### Dependent `@tag`s

- Whenever you tag the definition of an object or interface type, GraphOS automatically considers that tag to be applied to _all fields_ of that type:

  ```graphql
  type InternalUser @tag(name: "internal") {
    id: ID! # Also considered to have @tag(name: "internal")
  }
  ```

- Whenever you tag the definition of an object, interface, or union type, **you should always** apply that same tag to every field that _returns_ that type:

  ```graphql {1,7}
  type BillingAccount @tag(name: "internal") {
    id: ID!
    acctNumber: String!
  }

  type Query {
    billingAccounts: [BillingAccount!]! @tag(name: "internal")
  }
  ```

  - If you don't do this, a contract might exclude a type while including fields that return that type. This produces an invalid contract schema.

- If a contract excludes an object that implements an interface or is included in a union:

  - The contract is _not_ required to exclude schema fields that return that interface or union, as long as at least one other associated object type remains:

    ```graphql {1,7,13,20}
    # Two object types implement this interface.
    interface Identity {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    # If this implementing type is excluded...
    type InternalUser implements Identity @tag(name: "internal") {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    # ...but this implementing type remains...
    type ExternalUser implements Identity {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    type Query {
      # ...then this field doesn't need to be excluded.
      currentIdentity: Identity
    }
    ```

  - **However**, if a subgraph resolves one of these fields by returning an object of an excluded type, a runtime error occurs in the router and the operation fails.

### Special cases for filtering

- If a contract defines a list of Included Tags, any object or interface type _without_ an included tag is still included in the contract schema _if_ at least one of its _fields_ is included:

  ```graphql
  # This type definition is included because one if its fields is included.
  type User {
    id: ID! @tag(name: "includeMe")
  }
  ```

- If a contract excludes _every field_ of an object or interface type, the entire type definition is excluded from the contract schema:

  ```graphql
  # This object type is excluded because all of its fields are excluded.
  type User {
    id: ID! @tag(name: "excludeMe")
  }
  ```

  - This can produce an invalid contract schema if any fields that _return_ the excluded type are included.

- If a contract excludes _every object type_ that's part of a union type, the entire union type definition is excluded from the contract schema:

  ```graphql
  # This union type is excluded because all of its possible types are excluded.
  union Media = Book | Movie

  type Book @tag(name: "excludeMe") {
    title: String!
  }

  type Movie @tag(name: "excludeMe") {
    title: String!
  }
  ```

  - This can produce an invalid contract schema if any fields that _return_ the excluded union type are included.

- A contract _cannot_ exclude any of the following, even if tagged:

  - Built-in scalars (`Int`, `Float`, etc.)
  - Built-in directives (`@skip`, `@include`, etc.)
  - Custom directives that are applied to type system locations ([see the list](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#TypeSystemDirectiveLocation))

- A contract _can_ exclude object fields that are used in a computed field's [`@requires` directive](/federation/entities-advanced/#contributing-computed-entity-fields) without causing runtime errors.
