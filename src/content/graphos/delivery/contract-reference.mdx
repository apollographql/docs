## Rules for `@tag`s and contracts

### Valid `@tag` locations

**In both Federation 1 and Federation 2,** you can apply tags to the following schema elements to filter your contract schema:

- Object, interface, and union type definitions
- Fields of object types
  - Federation 1 doesn't support tagging fields of interface types.
  - In Federation 1, you can still make an interface field inaccessible by tagging the interface definition or by ensuring that object fields that implement the interface field are removed.

**In Federation 2 only,** you can also apply tags to the following:

- Fields of interface types
- Enum types and their values
- Input types and their fields
- Definitions of custom scalar types
- Arguments of fields, **but not directive arguments**

### Valid `@tag` names

- `@tag` names can include alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), along with hyphens (`-`) and forward slashes (`/`).
- Each tag name cannot exceed 128 characters.

```graphql {3}
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @tag(name: "a/b/c/1-2-3")
}
```

### Dependent `@tag`s

- Whenever you tag the definition of an object or interface type, GraphOS automatically considers that tag to be applied to all fields of that type:

  ```graphql
  type InternalUser @tag(name: "internal") {
    id: ID! # Also considered to have @tag(name: "internal")
  }
  ```

- Whenever you tag the definition of an object, interface, or union type, **you should always** apply that same tag to every field that returns that type:

  ```graphql {1,7}
  type BillingAccount @tag(name: "internal") {
    id: ID!
    acctNumber: String!
  }

  type Query {
    billingAccounts: [BillingAccount!]! @tag(name: "internal")
  }
  ```

  <Caution>

  If you don't do this, a contract might exclude a type while including fields that return that type. This produces an invalid contract schema.

  </Caution>

- If a contract excludes an object that implements an interface or is included in a union:

  - The contract is not required to exclude schema fields that return that interface or union as long as at least one other associated object type remains:

    ```graphql {1,7,13,20}
    # Two object types implement this interface.
    interface Identity {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    # If this implementing type is excluded...
    type InternalUser implements Identity @tag(name: "internal") {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    # ...but this implementing type remains...
    type ExternalUser implements Identity {
      id: ID!
      name: String!
    }

    type Query {
      # ...then this field doesn't need to be excluded.
      currentIdentity: Identity
    }
    ```

  - However, if a subgraph resolves one of these fields by returning an object of an excluded type, a runtime error occurs in the router and the operation fails.

### Special cases for filtering

- If a contract defines a list of included `@tags`, any object or interface type without an included tag is still included in the contract schema if at least one of its fields is included:

  ```graphql
  # This type definition is included because one if its fields is included.
  type User {
    id: ID! @tag(name: "includeMe")
  }
  ```

- If a contract excludes every field of an object or interface type, the entire type definition is excluded from the contract schema:

  ```graphql
  # This object type is excluded because all its fields are excluded.
  type User {
    id: ID! @tag(name: "excludeMe")
  }
  ```

  <Caution>

  This can produce an invalid contract schema if any fields that return the excluded type are included.

  </Caution>

- If a contract excludes every object type that's part of a union type, the entire union type definition is excluded from the contract schema:

  ```graphql
  # This union type is excluded because all its possible types are excluded.
  union Media = Book | Movie

  type Book @tag(name: "excludeMe") {
    title: String!
  }

  type Movie @tag(name: "excludeMe") {
    title: String!
  }
  ```

  <Caution>

  This can produce an invalid contract schema if any fields that return the excluded union type are included.

  </Caution>

- A contract cannot exclude any of the following, even if tagged:

  - Built-in scalars (`Int`, `Float`, etc.)
  - Built-in directives (`@skip`, `@include`, etc.)
  - Custom directives that are applied to type system locations ([see the list](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#TypeSystemDirectiveLocation))

- A contract can exclude object fields that are used in a computed field's [`@requires` directive](/federation/entities-advanced/#contributing-computed-entity-fields) without causing runtime errors.

## Errors

GraphOS may encounter the following errors when creating or updating a contract schema.
Errors descriptions include the step in the creation process where the error occurred:
