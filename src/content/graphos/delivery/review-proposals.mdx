## Review a proposal

Proposal creators and reviewers can review different aspects of a proposal from its non-editor tabs in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content).

- A proposal's **Overview** tab is where team members with [the appropriate permissions](./configure-proposals#configure-permissions-and-approvals) can:
  - View and edit a proposal's description by clicking the pencil icon on the **README**.
  - Use the **Proposal activity** log to monitor changes over time and leave overall commentary.
  - View the proposal's status and author.
  - Select reviewers.
- The [**Changes**](#changes) tab shows both a summary and detailed view of the schema changes that make up a proposal.
  - All viewers can also [provide commentary](#add-comments) on changes from the **Changes** tab.
- The [**Checks**](./propose-changes#schema-checks) tab shows all [schema checks](./schema-checks) that have run for [saved revisions](./propose-changes#save-revisions).

### Changes

A proposal's **Changes** tab shows both a **Summary** and **Detailed view** of the schema changes that make up a proposal:

/>

- The **Summary** shows the number of objects, interfaces, and other types that changed in the proposal. Each type shows the number of lines added, deleted, and modified.

- The **Detailed view** shows a collapsible diff for each changed type.

You can use the left nav to view changes for a particular subgraph, or see the changes in the context of the composed [supergraph schema](/federation/federated-types/overview/#supergraph-schema) or [resulting API schema](/federation/federated-types/overview/#api-schema).

#### Add comments

You can comment on any line in the detailed view's diff. Hover over the line and click the chat icon that appears.
