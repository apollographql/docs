Schema proposals are currently in invite-only [preview](/resources/product-launch-stages/#preview). Get in touch with your account team if you'd like to request access or have any questions or feedback.

This article describes actions in the **Proposal implementation** and **publication** stages of the [schema proposal workflow](./#proposal-workflow).

Once a schema proposal is **Approved**, its changes need to be implemented.
For those implementing the changes, [pulling the approved schema changes](#pull-proposed-schemas-with-rover) into their IDE is a great starting point.
The approved schema changes serve as a guide for resolvers and any other supporting code that needs to be implemented.

Once the changes are implemented, you can use schema checks to ensure your organization only [publishes changes approved through a proposal](#validate-changes-with-checks).

## Pull proposed schemas with Rover

The [`rover subgraph fetch` command](/rover/commands/subgraphs/#subgraph-fetch) can pull subgraph schemas from variants and proposals. To pull a subgraph schema from a proposal, use the proposal's ID instead of a variant name:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
rover subgraph fetch my-graph@p-101 --name subgraph
```

A proposal's ID is always prefixed with `p-` and followed by a number. You can find the proposal ID in the proposal's URL in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content). For example, a proposal with the following URL has an ID of `p-101`.

`https://studio.apollographql.com/graph/Example-supergraph/proposal/p-101/home`

<Note>

You can't push schema changes to proposals with the `rover subgraph publish` command.

</Note>

## Validate changes with checks

GraphOS provides [schema checks](../schema-checks) to help you identify breaking changes. You [run checks on local changes](../schema-checks#the-checks-lifecycle) before publishing them.

Since schema checks [run automatically on every revision](./creation#schema-checks) in a proposal, if your last revision's checks pass, any changes you implement locally from a proposal should pass too.
Regardless, it's best to run checks before publishing changes to make sure errors haven't crept in.

### Ensure changes match an approved proposal

You can [configure schema checks](./configuration/#configure-schema-checks) that run in GraphOS to include a **Proposals** task. Proposal checks verify that the changes a check is running on have matching and approved schema proposals.

Configuring the **Proposals** task's severity to **Error** ensures that only changes approved through the proposal process can be published. By setting the severity to **Warning** you can publish changes that haven't been approved and receive warnings about them.

<Note>

The Proposals task also checks _descriptions_ in the SDL. For example, the Proposals task fails if a matching approved proposal includes a description with a period and the change the check is running on doesn't.

</Note>

When a check with the **Proposals** task runs, you can see which changes match a proposal by clicking the **Proposals** task on the **Checks** page:

  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema proposals check task in Studio"
/>

- Changes with matching approved proposals show checkmark icons.
- Changes without matching approved proposals show warning or error icons depending on the [configured severity](./configuration#configure-schema-checks).

Clicking the icons reveals a list of matching proposals in the right panel.
Click **Ignore** to allow the Proposals task to succeed without matching approved proposals for all changes.

### Matching changes to proposals

**Incoming changes and approved proposals don't need to match one-to-one.**
For example, suppose you have an approved proposal with changes in multiple subgraphs. You can check each subgraph's changes separately. Each subgraph check still passes even though the change doesn't encompass all the approved proposal's changes.

Similarly, a single proposal can contain a large change in one subgraph that you want to divide into multiple checks. Those changes can match across multiple checks and each check passes.

## Publish changes to GraphOS

Publishing schema proposal changes follows the same [steps](../publishing-schemas) as publishing any other changes.

When a schema published to a [proposal's source variant](./creation/#start-a-proposal) contains changes that are in an **Approved**, **Open for Feedback**, or **Draft** proposal, the corresponding [launch](../launches) appears in the proposal's activity log.

<img
  src="../../img/schema-proposals/proposal-implementation-status.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="A matching launch appears on a schema proposal's activity log"
/>

When an **Approved** or **Open for feedback** proposal's changes have been fully implemented—[whether from one launch or many](#matching-changes-to-proposals)—the proposal's status changes to **Implemented**.

<Note>

- A proposal with **Draft** status can't become **Implemented**, even when all its changes are published. Once such a proposal's status is changed to **Open for feedback**, it automatically switches to **Implemented**.
- **Implemented** proposals can't receive further revisions, nor their status be changed.
