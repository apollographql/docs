<EnterpriseFeature linkWithAnchor="https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#delivery-pipeline" />

Your organization's validation needs might extend beyond default schema checks.
For example, you might want to enforce schema standards in addition to default [GraphOS linter rules](./linter-rules).
You might require validations that depend on external data, such as ensuring schema changes are only submitted from a specific branch in version control.
_Custom schema checks_ let you supplement default checks by executing custom validations using your own services.

## How custom checks work

Once you [configure custom checks](./custom-checks), GraphOS sends schema change information to an endpoint you specify.
Your endpoint performs validations and reports potential issues back to GraphOS via the [Platform API](/graphos/platform-api/).
GraphOS Studio displays the issues you report along with other check result details.

<Note>

You can only register one endpoint for custom checks, but that endpoint can perform as many different schema validations as you want.
You can write and deploy your validation service using whatever languages and frameworks you like.

</Note>

Custom checks run alongside other [check types](./schema-checks#types-of-checks) as part of every schema check run.
Like operations, linter, other check types, custom checks only run [after a build check has successfully completed](schema-checks#build-checks-1).

## Prerequisites

Custom checks require you use [Rover CLI](/rover/) version `0.27.0` or later.

## Configuration

Custom checks require you to set up an HTTPS endpoint that's accessible via the public internet.
You can set secret tokens to ensure that your endpoint only responds to requests sent by GraphOS.
Once you register your endpoint in GraphOS Studio, GraphOS sends it webhook notifications as POST requests.

### Set up a validation endpoint

Your validation endpoint should:

1. Be able to receive and process a POST request with a payload with [the specified JSON format](#webhook-format).
1. Send a `200` response to the request.
    - When GraphOS dispatches a webhook with check information, it has a 30-second timeout to receive a `200` response.
    - If the request times out or doesn't receive a `200`, it will retry up to five times, with an exponential backoff delay starting at 5 seconds and going up to 60 seconds.
1. [Submit validation check results](#submitting-a-check-result) to the GraphOS Platform API.

Outside of these requirements, you have the flexibility to implement any validations you need.

#### Webhook format

On every schema run, GraphOS sends your registered endpoint a POST request.
The request has a JSON payload with the following shape:

```json
{
  // Type of event, indicating a custom schema check in Apollo GraphOS
  "eventType": "APOLLO_CUSTOM_CHECK",
    // The unique identifier of the event
  "eventId": "UUID",
  // Version of the payload shape
  "version": "1",
  "checkStep": {
    // The unique identifier of the graph being validated
    "graphId": "string",
    // The variant of the graph (e.g., "current", "staging")
    "graphVariant": "string",
    // A unique identifier for the specific custom check task
    "taskId": "UUID",
    // A unique identifier for the workflow that initiated this check
    "workflowId": "UUID",
    "gitContext": {
      // The branch from which the schema change is being submitted
      "branch": "string",
      // The commit hash associated with the schema change
      "commit": "string",
      // The name or email of the person who committed the change
      "committer": "string",
      // The commit message describing the schema change
      "message": "string",
      // The URL of the remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab)
      "remoteUrl": "string"
    }
  },
  "baseSchema": {
    // The hash of the current base schema
    "hash": "string",
    // A list of subgraphs that make up the base schema (if using Apollo Federation)
    "subgraphs": [
      {
        // The hash of the subgraph schema
        "hash": "string",
        // The name of the subgraph
        "name": "string"
      }
    ]
  },
  "proposedSchema": {
    // The hash of the proposed schema
    "hash": "string",
    // A list of subgraphs in the proposed schema (if using Apollo Federation)
    "subgraphs": [
      {
        // The hash of the subgraph schema
        "hash": "string",
        // The name of the subgraph
        "name": "string"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<Note>

The `version` attribute is included because payloads may include additional properties in the future.

</Note>

Because schemas can be large, the payload provides schema hashes rather than full-text schemas.
Your endpoint can request the full schema contents using the [GraphOS Platform API](/graphos/platform-api/).
Refer to [Platform API docs](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/apollo-platform/home?variant=main) for instructions on making and authenticating requests.
See the examples below for fetching schema contents by hash.

Using the schema contents and payload information, your endpoint can perform whatever validations you need.

#### Fetch a single schema

To fetch a single supergraph or subgraph schema contents by hash, use the following GraphQL query on the Platform API:

```graphql
query schema($graphId: ID!, $hash: SHA256) {
  graph(id: $graphId) {
    doc(hash: $hash) {
      source
    }
  }
}
```

#### Fetch all schemas

To request all subgraphs and supergraph schema in one request, use the following GraphQL query on the Platform API:

```graphql
query schema(
  $graphId: ID!
  $supergraphHash: SHA256
  $subgraphAHash: SHA256
  $subgraphBHash: SHA256
) {
  graph(id: $graphId) {
    supergraph: doc(hash: $supergraphHash) {
      source
    }
    subgraphA: doc(hash: $subgraphAHash) {
      source
    }
    subgraphB: doc(hash: $subgraphBHash) {
      source
    }
  }
}
```

#### Submitting a check result

Once your endpoint has completed its validation, it should submit the results back to the triggering schema check run using the Platform API.
The triggering schema check run waits for a response for ten minutes and doesn't complete until it receives it.
If ten minutes pass without a response, the schema check run is marked as failed.

The results should include a list of violations, each with the following:

- `level`: Violation [severity level](./schema-linter/#setting-severity-levels), either `ERROR`, `WARN`, or `IGNORE`
- `rule`: Name of the violation type
- `message`: Error message

#### Example check results mutation

You can execute use the following GraphQL mutation on the Platform API to submit custom check results:

```graphql
mutation SchemaCheckCallback(
  $input: CustomCheckCallbackInput!
  $name: String!
  $graphId: ID!
) {
  graph(id: $graphId) {
    variant(name: $name) {
      customCheckCallback(input: $input) {
        __typename
        ... on CustomCheckResult {
          violations {
            level
            message
            rule
          }
        }
        ... on PermissionError {
          message
        }
        ... on TaskError {
          message
        }
        ... on ValidationError {
          message
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Enable custom checks in Studio

Once your endpoint is ready, you need to register it in GraphOS Studio.

1. In [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content), go to your graph's **Checks** page.
2. Select **Configuration** in the upper right to open the checks configuration page.
3. From the checks configuration page, open the **Custom Checks** section.
4. Toggle on the switch next to **Enable Custom Checks**.
5. Click the **Edit** button next to **Registered webhook** and enter the **Endpoint URL**.
6. Optionally, enter a **Secret Token**.

    If you enter a token, each notification HTTP request includes an `x-apollo-signature` header whose value is a [Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) generated using the token, the request body as the message, and the SHA256 hash function. The `x-apollo-signature` header has the format `sha256=<hmac-value>`.

    <ExpansionPanel title="See an example">

    Given the following inputs:

    **Secret token** (key): `your_secret_token`

    **Request body** (message):

    ```json
    {
        "to":"do"
    }
    ```

    **Hash function**: SHA256

    The `x-apollo-header` value would be `sha256=to-do`.
    </ExpansionPanel>

    Refer to this [guide from Okta](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/hmac/) to learn more about implementation and see additional resources.

You should now see your configured webhook on the checks configuration page and begin to receive custom check events at the specified endpoint whenever schema checks run.

## Example validation service implementation

Refer to the [example implementation](https://github.com/apollosolutions/custom-check-examples) for a custom check validation service that enforces GraphQL ESLint rules.
