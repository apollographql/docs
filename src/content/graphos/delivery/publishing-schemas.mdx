subtitle: Using the Rover CLI
description: Publish your GraphQL schemas to Apollo GraphOS using the Rover CLI in your continuous delivery pipeline.
---

Whenever you make changes to a graph's schema, you should publish those changes to Apollo GraphOS using the [Rover CLI](/rover) or the [Platform API](/graphos/platform-api/). Doing so ensures that Apollo always has an up-to-date understanding of your graph.

This page covers how to publish different kinds of schemas using the Rover CLI. Consult the [Platform API](/graphos/platform-api/) reference to learn how to use the API for publication.

<Tip>

Incorporate [schema proposals](./schema-proposals) into [schema checks](./schema-checks) to ensure your organization only publishes approved changes. [Learn more.](./schema-proposals/implementation#ensure-changes-match-an-approved-proposal)

</Tip>

## Prerequisites

1. [Install the Rover CLI](/rover/getting-started/).
2. [Authenticate Rover](/rover/configuring/#authenticating-with-graphos) with GraphOS.

## Publish subgraph schemas

Every supergraph in GraphOS includes one or more _subgraphs_. These are the individual GraphQL-powered microservices in your organization.

You individually publish each subgraph's schema to Apollo with `rover subgraph publish`:

```bash showLineNumbers=false title="Example command"
rover subgraph publish --schema ./products.graphql --name products docs-example-graph@current --routing-url https://products.example.com
```

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph " "
  subgraphA[Products<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphC[Inventory<br/>subgraph];
  end
  graphos{{GraphOS}};
  subgraphA & subgraphB & subgraphC -. rover subgraph publish  .-> graphos;
  class graphos secondary;
```

To publish a subgraph schema to Apollo:

1. Identify the name of the subgraph you're publishing to. You can view the names of your existing subgraphs from your variant's **Subgraphs** page in [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content).

2. If you're publishing a subgraph for the first time, also obtain the **routing URL** of that subgraph. This is the URL that your router will use to communicate with the subgraph.

   - If GraphOS already knows your subgraph's routing URL, you don't need to provide this value unless you're changing it.

3. Run the `rover subgraph publish` command and provide it your subgraph's schema in one of the ways shown:

   ```bash showLineNumbers=false

   # Provide a local .graphql file path
   rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name locations --routing-url https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ --schema ./schema.graphql

   # Provide an introspection result via stdin
   rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name locations --routing-url https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ --schema -
   ```

Whenever you publish a subgraph schema, GraphOS attempts to compose all latest versions of your subgraph schemas into a single supergraph schema for your router:

```mermaid
graph TB;
  serviceA[Subgraph<br/>schema<br/>A];
  serviceB[Subgraph<br/>schema<br/>B];
  serviceC[Subgraph<br/>schema<br/>C];
  composition[["ðŸ› <br/>Composition "]];
  supergraph{{"Supergraph schema<br/>(A + B + C + routing machinery)"}};
  serviceA & serviceB & serviceC --> composition;
  composition -- "(Composition succeeds)" --> supergraph;
  class composition tertiary;
```

If this composition succeeds, your router is updated with the result. This enables clients to query any newly added fields, and it prevents them from querying any removed fields.

You can manually fetch your router's latest supergraph schema with the `rover supergraph fetch` command, or retrieve it from your supergraph's **Schema > SDL** page in GraphOS Studio.

## Publish monograph schemas

<Note>

These instructions apply only to [monographs](../graphs/#monographs), which are not recommended.

</Note>

1. Decide how you'll provide your server's schema to Rover. You can either:

   - Use a `.gql` or `.graphql` file saved on your local machine, or
   - Perform an introspection query on your running server to fetch the schema

2. Run the `rover graph publish` command, providing your schema in one of the ways shown:

   ```bash showLineNumbers=false

   # Provide a local .graphql file path
   rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

   # Provide an introspection result via stdin
   rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema -
   ```

   As shown, the first positional argument you provide `rover graph publish` is a [graph ref](/rover/conventions/#graph-refs), a string that specifies a particular variant of a particular graph in GraphOS.

## Publish with continuous delivery

To get the most out of GraphOS, you should publish each update to any production schema as soon as it occurs. Consequently, schema publishing should be part of your continuous delivery pipeline.

Here's a sample continuous delivery configuration for schema publishing in CircleCI:

```yaml
version: 2

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/node:8

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run: npm install

      - run:
          name: Install Rover
          # highlight-start
          command: |
            # Download and install Rover
            # This is pinned to a specific version for predictability in CI
            curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/v0.8.1 | sh

            # This allows the PATH changes to persist to the next `run` step
            echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.rover/bin:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
          # highlight-end

      # Start the GraphQL server.  If a different command is used to
      # start the server, use it in place of `npm start` here.
      - run:
          name: Starting server
          command: npm start
          background: true

      # make sure the server has enough time to start up before running
      # commands against it
      - run: sleep 5

      # highlight-start
      # When running on the 'main' branch, push the latest version
      # of the schema to GraphOS.
      - run: |
          if [ "${CIRCLE_BRANCH}" == "main" ]; then
            rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant \
              --schema ./schema.graphql \
              --name locations \
              --routing-url https://products.example.com
          fi
      # highlight-end
```
