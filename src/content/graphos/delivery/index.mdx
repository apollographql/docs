description: Efficiently develop and deploy changes to your GraphQL schema with the Apollo GraphOS suite of schema governance and delivery tools.

GraphOS provides schema pipeline tools to efficiently develop and deploy changes to your supergraph schema. These tools fall into two main categories:

- **Schema governance** tools let you manage, validate, and enforce consistency standards in your supergraph schema to ensure reliability and compatibility across different services and teams.
- **Schema delivery** tools let you integrate schema publication seamlessly into your DevOps workflows.

## Schema governance

GraphOS provides the following schema governance tools:

- [Schema checks](./schema-checks) help identify breaking changes before you make them and help determine when a potentially dangerous change is, in fact, safe.
- [Schema linting](./schema-linter) ensures consistent, well-formed schemas across all your services. Automated linting lowers maintenance overheads and improves developer productivity. Schema linting can run as part of schema checks in GraphOS Studio and as one-offs via the Rover CLI.

## Schema delivery

Schema delivery refers to the process of making your supergraph schema available to clients. You can publish schema changes [using the Rover CLI](./publishing-schemas) or [GraphOS Platform API](/graphos/platform-api). Using the Rover CLI command enables you to easily integrate publication into your continuous delivery pipeline.

To incorporate other important aspects of your supergraph configuration, such as your router configuration or federation version, GraphOS uses the concept of [**launches**](./launches). Schema publications trigger launches, and you can monitor them from the **Launches** page in GraphOS Studio.

### Contracts

GraphOS [**contracts**](./contracts) are an enterprise feature that let you deliver _different_ subsets of your supergraph to different consumers. Contracts rely on `@tags` across various subgraph schemas to denote which types and fields are accessible to different consumers.

## Client operation validation

In addition to the governance and delivery tools for schema developers, Apollo provides a CLI command for app developers to confirm that GraphQL operations in a client application are compatible with the published schema. Refer to the [Validating client operations page](/rover/validating-client-operations) for more information.
