title: Launches
---

In GraphOS, a **launch** represents the complete process of making a set of updates to a supergraph, usually initiated by changes to one of its subgraphs.

These updates might include:

- Adding, removing, or modifying types and fields in a subgraph schema
- Adding or removing entire subgraphs
- Migrating types or fields between subgraphs

In some cases, a launch might consist entirely of changes that don't affect your supergraph's public API (such as migrating fields between subgraphs).

## Launch status

Your supergraph's Launches page in Apollo Studio enables you to observe and monitor the schema delivery process for both in-progress and past launches:

The green **PUBLISHED** badge indicates which launch corresponds to your graph's current published schema.

Selecting a launch provides a breakdown of its individual steps and any errors or warnings that occurred during it:

From this detail view, you can view the timestamp and other details for each step in the launch process, including any [schema checks](./schema-checks) that failed. You can also view the launch's associated supergraph schema (or any build errors if composition failed).

## What's in a launch?

A launch encapsulates the following steps for a supergraph:

```mermaid
graph TB;
  subgraph "The steps of a launch"
  subgraphPublished(You publish a subgraph <br/>schema update to Apollo) --> composition(Apollo performs supergraph schema<br/>composition with latest subgraph schemas);
  composition --"If composition succeeds..."-->checks(Apollo runs schema checks if enabled);
  checks-->uplink(Updated supergraph schema is<br/>made available via Apollo Uplink);
  uplink-->studio(Studio updates UI and sends<br/>build status webhook notifications<br/>to reflect new published schema);
  uplink --> gateways(Your router begins using<br/>the new published schema);
  studio --> complete(Launch complete);
  gateways-->complete;
  composition --"If composition fails,<br/>the launch fails"--> complete;
  end
```
