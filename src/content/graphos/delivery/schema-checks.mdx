subtitle: Validate proposed changes to your schema are safe
description: Use GraphOS Schema checks to identify and validate potential breaking changes in your GraphQL schema before deployment.
---

Certain changes to your graph's schema (such as removing a field or type) might break one of your application's clients. GraphOS schema checks help you identify breaking changes before you make them. They can also help you identify when a potentially dangerous change is, in fact, safe.

You can review the results of schema checks inside GraphOS Studio from your graph's **Checks** page, helping you make informed decisions about evolving your graph:

With the exception of [proposal and contract checks](#types-of-checks), schema checks are free as part of [all Apollo plans](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/).

## Types of checks

GraphOS can perform the following types of schema checks:

<table className="field-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Check Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

#### Composition checks

</td>
<td>
For supergraphs, verify whether proposed changes to a subgraph
schema successfully compose with other subgraph schemas.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### Operation checks

</td>
<td>
Compare proposed schema changes against historical operations to
verify whether the changes break any of your graph's active clients.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### Linter checks

</td>
<td>
Analyze your proposed schema changes for violations of formatting rules
and other GraphQL best practices.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### Proposal checks

(Enterprise only)

</td>
<td>
Check whether your proposed schema changes have matching and approved{' '}
<a href="./schema-proposals">schema proposals</a>.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

#### Contract checks

(Enterprise only)

</td>
<td>

When running schema checks on a source variant, also check whether your
proposed schema changes break any downstream [contract](./contracts) variants.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This article provides further details on composition and operation checks.

- For details on linter checks, see [Schema linting](./schema-linter/).
- For details on proposal checks, see [Schema proposals check configuration](./schema-proposals/configuration#configure-schema-checks).
- For details on contract checks, see [Contract checks](./contract-setup/#run-contract-checks).

### Composition checks

When you run a schema check, GraphOS performs a _composition check_ before performing any other checks. A composition check verifies that changes you make to a subgraph schema are valid GraphQL definitions and are compatible with your other subgraph schemas, enabling them to [compose](/federation/federated-types/composition/) into a supergraph schema for your router.

If a composition check fails, GraphOS does not perform any other checks for the provided schema.

From your graph's **Checks** page in GraphOS Studio, you can click a particular composition check to view its result. If composition succeeded, you can view the composed supergraph schema. Regardless of success, you can view the proposed subgraph schema.

### Operation checks

If a composition check succeeds, GraphOS then validates schema changes with _operation checks_. Operation checks use your graph's historical client operation data to determine whether any clients would be negatively affected by the proposed schema changes. For example, an operation check would flag a change that removes a field that multiple clients use in their operations.

## Limitations

### Operation check cardinality

Operation checks will run against a maximum of 10,000 distinct operations. A warning message will display in Studio when a larger cardinality has been reached.

### Input field usage reporting

<Note>

This limitation only applies to reporting metrics from Apollo Server and older versions of the Apollo Router Core.

If you use the GraphOS Router to [report operation metrics](../metrics/sending-operation-metrics), you can configure [enhanced operation signature normalization](/router/configuration/overview/#enhanced-operation-signature-normalization) and [extended reference reporting](/router/configuration/overview/#extended-reference-reporting) to track input field usage.

</Note>

GraphOS tracks operation usage. To deduplicate operations, Apollo uses [operation signatures](../metrics/operation-signatures) which denormalize the arguments and inputs. This means that the result of the operation signature does not track which fields on input types are used.

For example, GraphOS will not be able to track how many times the input field `GetUsersInput.firstName` is used in this schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  getUsers(filters: GetUsersInput): [User]
}

input GetUsersInput {
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}
```

## Next steps

To learn how to run your first check, integrate checks into your CI pipeline, and customize checks behavior, refer to [Run schema checks](./check-configurations).
You can also [connect schema checks to GitHub](./github-integration) to add links to check results on the pull requests that initiate them. See the [Checks reference](./checks-reference) for the types of schema changes that checks detect.
