title: Configuring schema checks
subtitle: Define how schema checks are applied to schema changes
description: Learn how to customize your GraphQL schema checks using Apollo GraphOS Studio or Rover CLI.
---

After you [enable schema checks](./schema-checks/) for your graph, you can customize their behavior to suit your use case. For example, you can:

- Exclude past operations that were executed by a particular client, such as a client that you only use for testing
- Exclude past operations that were executed relatively infrequently
- Check schema changes against multiple graph variants

## Using GraphOS Studio (recommended)

In [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content), you can configure default rules that are applied to every executed schema check. You define these rules from the **Configuration** tab of your variant's **Checks** page:

  alt="Check configuration page in GraphOS Studio"
/>

### Configuration options

- **Time range**: Include all distinct operations that were executed within this range. The default value is 7 days ("Within the last week").
- **Operation count threshold**: Exclude all operations that were executed fewer than this number of times within the specified **time range**.
- **Variants**: Include all distinct operations that were executed against each selected variant of your graph. The default value is "Base variant" (that is, whichever variant schema checks are being run against).
- **Client exclusions**: Exclude all operations that were executed by particular clients, such as clients used exclusively for development and testing.

## Using the Rover CLI

You can customize a single run of schema checks by providing options to the Rover CLI. If you've also [configured default rules](#using-graphos-studio-recommended) for schema checks, any command-line options you provide take precedence over those rules.

### Validation period

You can provide the `--validation-period` option to specify how far back in time Studio should look when determining the compatibility of past operations with the changes to your schema (by default, the command uses the last 7 days of operations).

This command checks schema changes against the past two weeks of operations:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
rover subgraph check docs-example-graph@current --name products --schema ./schema.graphql --validation-period="2 weeks"
```

Valid durations are represented as any combination of `years`, `months`, `weeks`, `days`, `min`, and `sec`:

- `1 month 2 weeks`
- `525600 min`

<Note>

If you specify a `--validation-period` that exceeds your organization's operation retention period, the `subgraph check` command fails with an error.

</Note>

### Threshold values

You can provide _threshold values_ to Rover to ignore historical operations that are relatively rare.

For example, you might want to discontinue support for an old version of your client that uses deprecated fields. You can set threshold values to determine when an acceptably small number of users are using the outdated client, thus reducing the impact of discontinuing support.

Provide threshold values with the following flags:

- `--query-count-threshold` - Check your schema only against operations that have been executed at least the specified number of times within the specified duration.
- `--query-percentage-threshold` - Check your schema only against operations that account for at least the specified percentage of all operations against the graph within the specified duration. For example, specify `3` to set this threshold to 3%.

<Note>

You can provide values for both of these flags. If you do, an operation must meet or exceed both thresholds for schema checks to include it.

</Note>

Here's an example of running `rover subgraph check` with threshold values:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
rover subgraph check docs-example-graph@current \
  # Path to schema file
  --schema ./schema.graphql
  # Name of subgraph with schema updates
  --name products
  # Check the schema against operations that have run in the last 5 days
  --validation-period="5 days" \
  # Only check against operations that have run at least 5 times during the 5-day duration
  --query-count-threshold=5 \
  # Only check against operations that account for at least 3% of total operation volume
  --query-percentage-threshold=3
```

To request other filtering or threshold mechanisms, please get in touch with us on the [Rover repository](https://github.com/apollographql/rover).

### Checking against multiple environments

You might want to check schema changes against multiple environments, such as production, staging, and beta. Each of these environments might have a slightly different schema to support features that are experimental or in active development. In GraphOS, these schemas are represented as [variants](../graphs/#variants) of a single graph.

You specify which variant you want to check against in the [graph ref](/rover/conventions/#graph-refs) you provide to `rover subgraph check`:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
rover subgraph check docs-example-graph@staging --name products --schema ./schema.graphql
```

The graph ref `docs-example-graph@staging` specifies the `staging` variant of the `docs-example-graph` graph.

To check your schema against multiple variants, call `rover subgraph check` once for each variant. Doing so results in status checks similar to the following:
