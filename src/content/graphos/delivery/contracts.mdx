<EnterpriseFeature />

A unified supergraph provides a single source of truth for your organization's data. That data likely has different consumers with different needs and permissions. GraphOS **contracts** enable you to deliver different subsets of your supergraph to different consumers.

```mermaid
graph LR;

    serviceA("Complete<br/>supergraph schema<br/>▉");

    serviceB2("Contract <br/>schema B<br/>▟");


    serviceA2("Contract <br/>schema A<br/>▛");

  serviceA -."Filter schema <br/>according to contract A".->serviceA2
  serviceA -."Filter schema <br/>according to contract B".->serviceB2
```

Each contract can include different fields and types from each subgraph.

## Benefits of contracts

Contracts offer these benefits:

- **Selective data access**: Supergraphs often contain a wide range of data, including experimental data or information that's irrelevant to specific audiences. Contracts declaratively grant access to specific parts of the supergraph, so graph consumers only access the relevant data.

- **Data security and privacy**: Contracts bolster data security and privacy by enabling the exclusion of confidential data from certain consumers. This ensures that only authorized parties can access sensitive data.

- **Documentation and guidance**: Contracts provide [documentation](#contract-documentation) to client developers. Contract-specific documentation helps developers better understand and more easily interact with the data they are authorized to access.

## How contracts work

Each contract filters specific portions of your supergraph's schema into a **different GraphOS [variant](/graphos/graphs/federated-graphs/#supergraph-variants)**:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph "Source variant";
  api("Complete<br/>supergraph schema<br/>▉");
  end
  subgraph "Contract variant B"
  contractB("Contract <br/>schema B<br/>▟")
  end
  subgraph "Contract variant A"
  contractA("Contract <br/>schema A<br/>▛");
  end
  api -."Filter schema<br/>according to contract A".->contractA
  api -."Filter schema<br/>according to contract B".->contractB
```

Contracts are created by adding `@tag` directives to your subgraph schemas. `@tag`s declare which types and fields to _exclude_ from specific contract variants.

```graphql {4} title="Source variant subgraph schema"
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  codename: String! @tag(name: "internal")
}
```

```graphql title="Contract variant API schema"
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  # codename field is filtered out
}
```

In the above example, a contract excludes types and fields marked with the `internal` `@tag`. The resulting contract schema defines a tailored GraphQL API for external audiences.

## How to use contracts

You usually create a contract to support a **contract router**, **contract documentation**, or both.

### Contract routers

You can deploy a [managed instance](/federation/managed-federation/overview/) of your graph router that uses a contract schema. Clients that use a contract router's endpoint can only execute GraphQL operations that the contract schema supports:

```mermaid
graph BT;
  adminapp(Admin app);
  userapp(User app);
  subgraph " ";
    standardgateway(["Standard router<br/>▉"]);
    contractgateway(["Contract router<br/>▟"]);
    subgraphs[["Supergraph<br/>(all subgraphs)"]];
  end;
  userapp -.- contractgateway;
  adminapp -.- standardgateway;
  standardgateway & contractgateway --- subgraphs;
  class adminapp,userapp secondary;
```

This enables you to hide experimental types and fields still in development or limit a particular audience's access to only the portions of your graph they need.

Contract routers can safely connect to the same subgraph instances as any other router because their clients can only interact with data represented in the contract schema. This does not affect internal routing. For example, filtered fields can still be used in a [`@requires`](/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#requires) selection set.

<Note>

Any `@tag` in a source variant's supergraph schema is _also_ present in a contract variant's supergraph schema.

</Note>

### Contract documentation

In GraphOS Studio, each contract variant has its own README, schema reference, and Explorer. If you [make a contract variant public](../graphs/studio-features/#public-variants), you can provide these resources to external client developers to help them interact with a specific portion of your graph while omitting irrelevant types and fields.

## Federation 1 limitations

Contracts behave slightly differently depending on which version of Apollo Federation your graph uses—either Federation 1 or Federation 2. Most importantly, graphs that use Federation 1 _cannot_ use `@tag`s to exclude the following from a contract schema:

- Custom scalar types (default scalar types can _never_ be excluded in Federation 1)
- Enum types or their values
- Input types or their fields
- Arguments of object fields or interface fields

### Contracts and Federation 2

To create a contract variant that uses Federation 2, the contract's source variant must _also_ use Federation 2.

#### Moving an existing contract to Federation 2

If a Federation 1 source variant already has one or more associated contracts, it isn't possible to move that variant or its contract variants to Federation 2. Instead, you need to **delete and recreate** your contract variants with the following steps:

<ExpansionPanel>

1. Identify the source variant you want to move to Federation 2.
2. Save the details for each of that source variant's existing contract variants, most importantly each variant's associated filters.
3. Delete all of the source variant's existing contract variants.
4. Now that the source variant has no associated contracts, you can configure it to use Federation 2 composition. [Learn how](/federation/federation-2/moving-to-federation-2#step-2-configure-your-composition-method).
5. Recreate your deleted contract variants, which will now use Federation 2 composition like the modified source variant.
