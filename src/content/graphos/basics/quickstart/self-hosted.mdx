This tutorial helps you get you up and running with GraphOS and a self-hosted supergraph. You can complete this tutorial even if your organization _doesn't_ currently have an Enterprise plan, enabling you to test out this functionality.

## Supergraph concepts

Before we get started, let's quickly cover what a self-hosted supergraph _is_.

A **supergraph** combines multiple GraphQL APIs into a single unified GraphQL service. The individual APIs in a supergraph are called **subgraphs**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Supergraph"
  direction LR
    router(["Router"]);
    serviceA[Subgraph A];
    serviceB[Subgraph B];
    serviceC[Subgraph C];
    router --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
  end
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

A separate service called the **router** sits in front of your subgraphs and provides the publicly accessible endpoint for your supergraph. Clients query the router, which distributes each query across the appropriate combination of subgraphs and returns the combined result.

The router uses a special GraphQL schema called the **supergraph schema**. This schema incorporates the types and fields in each subgraph schema, along with metadata that enables the router to correctly distribute queries across subgraphs.

A **_self-hosted_ supergraph** is a supergraph with a router that you host and manage in your _own infrastructure_. This is in contrast to a [**cloud supergraph**](./cloud/), which uses a router that's hosted and managed by Apollo.

We'll cover these concepts in more detail as we proceed through the steps below.

## 1. Set up Apollo tools

This quickstart uses the following Apollo tools:

* **Apollo Studio.** This is the primary web interface for GraphOS. Studio helps you monitor, manage, and collaborate on your supergraph.
* **The Rover CLI.** This is the primary _command-line_ interface for GraphOS. Rover helps you interact with your graphs and their schemas.

Let's set these up first.

#### Create an Apollo account

To manage our supergraph with GraphOS, we need an Apollo account. Let's create one if you don't have one yet.

Complete the first step of <a href="./cloud/#1-create-your-apollo-account" target="_blank">Get started with GraphOS</a> (**Create your Apollo account**), then return here.

#### Create a graph in Apollo Studio

After you create your Apollo account, create your first graph in Apollo Studio by following the instructions for your organization's [plan type](../org/plans/):

> If you just created your organization as part of creating your account, it's on a **Serverless** plan type.

<ExpansionPanel title="Serverless plans">

1. Go to your organization's **Graphs** tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content).

    - **If you see this dialog...**

        <img
          src="../../img/studio-welcome.jpg"
          class="screenshot"
          alt="Welcome message for new Studio orgs"
          width="350"
        />

        ...then click **Coming from Apollo Odyssey, or want to connect a self-managed router?**

    - **Otherwise,** find the following notice in the bottom-right corner of the page:

        <img
          src="../../img/classic-graph-flow.jpg"
          class="screenshot"
          alt="Link to classic graph flow"
          width="300"
        />

        Click **Head over to our classic graph flow**.

    In either case, Studio displays the following dialog for creating a graph:

    <img
      className="screenshot"
      src="../../img/graph-creation.jpg"
      width="350"
      style="margin-bottom: 20px;"
    />

2. Specify an organization and title for your graph.

3. Leave the **Graph Architecture** as **Supergraph (default)**.

4. Click **Next**. A dialog like the following appears:

    <img
     src="../../img/register-schema-dialog.jpg"
     class="screenshot"
     alt="Schema registration options"
     width="500"
    />

5. Leave the **Supergraph Pipeline Track** dropdown set to its default value.

Your graph has been created, and it appears in the **Classic Graphs** section of your **Graphs** tab.

</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="Enterprise and legacy plans">

1. Go to your organization's **Graphs** tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content).

2. Click **New Graph** in the top right. Studio displays the following dialog:

    <img
      className="screenshot"
      src="../../img/graph-creation.jpg"
      width="350"
      style="margin-bottom: 20px;"
    />

3. Specify an organization and title for your graph.

3. Leave the **Graph Architecture** as **Supergraph (default)**.

5. Click **Next**. A dialog like the following appears:

    <img
     src="../../img/register-schema-dialog.jpg"
     class="screenshot"
     alt="Schema registration options"
     width="500"
    />

6. Leave the **Supergraph Pipeline Track** dropdown set to its default value.

Your graph has been created.

</ExpansionPanel>

#### Install the Rover CLI

**Rover** is Apollo's CLI for managing all kinds of graphs, including subgraphs and supergraphs. We'll use it throughout this quickstart.

> Even if you already have Rover installed, you should update your version now by completing this step.

Install the latest Rover release with the appropriate command for your system:

```bash title="Mac/Unix"
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/latest | sh
```

```bash title="Windows"
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/latest' | iex
```

After installing, run `rover` in your terminal with no arguments to confirm that it installed successfully. Verify that the printed version number matches the [latest full release](https://github.com/apollographql/rover/releases) (if it doesn't, you might need to manually delete a previous outdated installation).

#### Authenticate Rover with GraphOS

We'll use Rover to publish our subgraph schemas to GraphOS. To do that, we first need to _authenticate_ Rover with GraphOS.

Complete the first two steps of <a href="/rover/configuring/" target="_blank">Configuring Rover</a> (**Obtain an API key** and **Provide the API key to Rover**), then return here.

## 2. Create a router project directory

With a self-hosted supergraph, you're responsible for deploying and managing your supergraph's **router**. The router provides the public endpoint that clients use to query your supergraph:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Locations<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

For this quickstart, we'll use some Apollo-hosted example services as our subgraphs, and we'll set up **the Apollo Router** in front of them. The Apollo Router is a high-performance, precompiled Rust executable that acts as the router for a supergraph.

Start by using the [GitHub template](https://github.com/apollographql/router-template) to create a new Router project. This comes with all the basics you need to run Router in a Docker container. Click "Use this template" to create a new repository in your GitHub account, then clone that repository to your local machine.

To run the Router locally, you'll need a way to build and run containers, some popular options are:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/personal/)
- [Rancher](https://rancherdesktop.io)
- [Podman](https://podman.io)

For the rest of this tutorial, we'll be using the `docker` command, but commands for the alternatives should look very similar. Let's try starting the router:

```bash
docker build -t router .
docker run -it -p4000:4000 router
```

When you do, you'll get a startup error message like the following:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

```
Apollo Router v1.18.0 // (c) Apollo Graph, Inc. // Licensed as ELv2 (https://go.apollo.dev/elv2)

‚ö†Ô∏è  The Apollo Router requires a composed supergraph schema at startup. ‚ö†Ô∏è

üëâ DO ONE:

  * Pass a local schema file with the '--supergraph' option:

      $ ./router --supergraph <file_path>

  * Fetch a registered schema from Apollo Studio by setting
    these environment variables:

      $ APOLLO_KEY="..." APOLLO_GRAPH_REF="..." ./router

      For details, see the Apollo docs:
      https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/managed-federation/setup

üî¨ TESTING THINGS OUT?

  1. Download an example supergraph schema with Apollo-hosted subgraphs:

    $ curl -L https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > starstuff.graphql

  2. Run the Apollo Router in development mode with the supergraph schema:

    $ ./router --dev --supergraph starstuff.graphql
```

</ExpansionPanel>

That's because we aren't currently providing a **supergraph schema** to the router! We'll fix that soon.

## 3. Obtain your subgraph schemas


<blockquote>


This quickstart uses two Apollo-hosted subgraphs (named Locations and Reviews) from an imaginary space tourism application called FlyBy. Here are their URLs and schemas for reference:

<ExpansionPanel title="Locations">

URL: `https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/`

```graphql title="Locations"
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key"])

type Query {
  "The full list of locations presented by the Interplanetary Space Tourism department"
  locations: [Location!]!
  "The details of a specific location"
  location(id: ID!): Location
}

type Location @key(fields: "id"){
  id: ID!
  "The name of the location"
  name: String!
  "A short description about the location"
  description: String!
  "The location's main photo as a URL"
  photo: String!
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

<ExpansionPanel title="Reviews">

URL: `https://flyby-reviews-sub.herokuapp.com/`

```graphql title="Reviews"
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0",
        import: ["@key"])

type Query {
  "The three latest reviews submitted for FlyBy's locations"
  latestReviews: [Review!]!
}

type Mutation {
  submitReview(locationReview: LocationReviewInput): SubmitReviewResponse
}

type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  "The calculated overall rating based on all reviews"
  overallRating: Float
  "All submitted reviews about this location"
  reviewsForLocation: [Review]!
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  "Written text"
  comment: String
  "A number from 1 - 5 with 1 being lowest and 5 being highest"
  rating: Int
  "The location the review is about"
  location: Location
}

input LocationReviewInput {
  "Written text"
  comment: String!
  "A number from 1 - 5 with 1 being lowest and 5 being highest"
  rating: Int!
  "Location Id"
  locationId: String!
}

type SubmitReviewResponse {
  "Similar to HTTP status code, represents the status of the mutation"
  code: Int!
  "Indicates whether the mutation was successful"
  success: Boolean!
  "Human-readable message for the UI"
  message: String!
  "Newly created review"
  locationReview: Review
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

When using your own subgraphs, you will use Rover to publish their schemas from their repos, typically in your CI pipeline. If you have your own existing subgraphs that you want to use instead of these examples, feel free! Provide their names and URLs wherever you see the example subgraphs used in the steps below.

</blockquote>

To compose a supergraph schema for our router, GraphOS needs the following information about each of our **subgraphs**:

* The subgraph's schema
* The URL of the subgraph's GraphQL endpoint (which must be accessible by the router)

Fortunately, we have all of this information! Let's send it to GraphOS.

> üí° **In most supergraphs,** each subgraph schema lives in the codebase for its associated subgraph. Because we're using remotely-hosted example subgraphs in this quickstart, we're saving these subgraph schemas in our router project for convenience.

## 4. Publish your subgraph schemas

With Rover already configured, we can use the Rover CLI's `subgraph publish` command to publish our subgraph schemas to GraphOS.

In [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content), click the graph you created back in the first step. Because we haven't published a schema to it yet, the following dialog appears:

<img
  src="../../img/register-schema-dialog.jpg"
  class="screenshot"
  alt="Schema registration options"
  width="600"
/>

We're going to use a similar command to the "Introspection" option, but we don't need the `APOLLO_KEY` variable because we configured Rover earlier. If you set up a `--profile` with Rover, be sure to use it here! The first subgraph can be published like this:

```bash
rover subgraph introspect https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ | \
rover subgraph publish --name locations \
--routing-url https://flyby-locations-sub.herokuapp.com/ \
--schema - <GRAPH_REF>
```

<blockquote>

Note that you need to replace `<GRAPH_REF>` above with the appropriate value for _your_ graph. In our screenshot above, this is `MyGraph-1ncyus@current` but **your value will be different**.

<ExpansionPanel title="What's a graph ref?">

A **graph ref** uniquely identifies a particular **variant** of a particular graph in GraphOS. Every graph ref is a string with the following format:

`graph-id@variant-name`

- The value before the `@` is your graph's unique ID in GraphOS.
- The value after the `@` is the name of the graph variant you're interacting with.

Each **variant** of a graph represents a different _environment_ where that graph runs (such as staging and production). For this quickstart, you can keep the default suggested variant name or change it to anything else you like (e.g., `quickstart`). Just make sure to provide the _same_ graph ref to every command in this quickstart!

_After_ you've published a schema to a particular variant, that variant's graph ref is always available at the top of its README page:

<img class="screenshot" alt="Graph ref in Studio" src="../../img/studio-graph-ref.jpg" width="300"/>

</ExpansionPanel>

</blockquote>

Paste the command into your terminal, replace `<GRAPH_REF>` with your value, and run it. If the command is successful, you'll see output like the following:

```
A new subgraph called 'locations' was created in 'docs-example-graph@main'
The supergraph schema for 'docs-example-graph@main' was updated, composed from the updated 'locations' subgraph
```

Nice! If you open your graph's details in Studio now, you'll see types and fields from our `locations` subgraph listed on the Schema page:

<img class="screenshot" alt="Locations subgraph schema in Studio" src="../../img/qs-studio-schema.jpg" width="300"/>

Next, let's do the same thing for our `reviews` subgraph, **again substituting your graph ref**:

```bash
rover subgraph introspect https://flyby-reviews-sub.herokuapp.com/ | \
rover subgraph publish --name reviews \
--routing-url https://flyby-reviews-sub.herokuapp.com/ \
--schema - <GRAPH_REF>
```

> You only need to provide a subgraph's `--routing-url` the _first_ time you publish that subgraph's schema to a particular variant (unless you need to change that URL later).

If you refresh the Schema page in Studio, you'll now see types and fields from our `reviews` service as well.

Every time we publish a subgraph schema, GraphOS automatically composes _all_ of our subgraph schemas into a **supergraph schema**! However, our router isn't yet _fetching_ that schema from Apollo. We'll tackle that next.

## 5. Connect the router to GraphOS

It's time to enable our router to fetch its supergraph schema from GraphOS. To do that, we'll need a **graph API key** that we set as the value of an environment variable. We recommend that you create a separate API key for each system that communicates with GraphOS. This reduces the impact whenever you need to _replace_ an API key that might be compromised.

1. Obtain a graph API key for your Studio graph by <a href="../api-keys/#graph-api-keys" target="_blank">following these steps</a>. If you have an Enterprise plan, set the API key's role to **Contributor**.

    > Make sure to copy and paste the API key's value somewhere so you can reference it (for security, API keys are not visible in Studio after creation).

2. Create a file called `.env` in your Router project and paste in the following (replacing `<API_KEY>` with your graph API key and `<GRAPH_REF>` with your graph ref):

    ```
    APOLLO_KEY=<API_KEY>
    APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<GRAPH_REF>
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them outside your organization or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised. The provided template has `.env` added to `.gitignore`, if you are not using the template, make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

3. Paste this command into your terminal and run it:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --env-file .env -p4000:4000 router
    ```

    This time there's no error, and you'll see output similar to the following (timestamps omitted for brevity):

    <ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand">

    ```

    ```

    </ExpansionPanel>

    > By providing an API key to the router, you also automatically enable **operation metrics reporting** to GraphOS, enabling you visualize your graph's performance. [Learn more about metrics.](../metrics/)

Now that our router is running, we can quickly open our browser to `localhost:4000` to explore our composed schema in Apollo Sandbox:

<img src="../../img/gateway_sandbox.jpg" class="screenshot" alt="Schema view in Apollo Sandbox" width="600" />

While we're here, execute some test queries against the supergraph! We'll look at metrics for those test queries in the next step.

## 6. View operation metrics

Because our router is connected to GraphOS, it automatically collects and reports metrics on incoming operations. You can then visualize those metrics in Studio.

Return to [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com?referrer=docs-content) and go to your supergraph variant's Operations page, which looks like this:

<img
  src="../../img/operations-quickstart.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="The Operations page in Studio after executing an operation"
/>

The test queries you executed in the previous step should already be represented on this page! (If they aren't there yet, check the page again in a few minutes.) After you update all of your clients to query your router, the Operations page becomes vital to monitoring your supergraph's performance.

## 7. Deploy your router and connect clients

Now that our router is running successfully in our development environment, we can deploy it to our preferred platform (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) so clients can begin querying it!

The exact details for deploying the router depend on which platform you use, but these high-level steps hold true for most platforms:

1. Build the Docker image in CI and push it to a container registry (some providers let you skip this step).
2. Deploy the image to your preferred platform (there are [additional resources for Kubernetes deployments](/docs/router/containerization/kubernetes))
3. Set the `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` environment variables in the router's deployment environment, as we did locally in [this step](#5-connect-the-router-to-graphos).
    - Keep in mind that `APOLLO_KEY` is a secret, so use an appropriate mechanism for storing it in your deployment environment.

4. If your platform expects the router to listen on a particular port, set this port in the [`router.yaml`](https://github.com/dbanty/enterprise-router-test/blob/main/router.yaml) file included with the template:

    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    supergraph:
      # The socket address and port to listen on
      listen: 127.0.0.1:4000
      # OR if the port is specified via environment variable
      listen: 127.0.0.1:${env.PORT}
    ```

    > Learn more about [router configuration options](/router/configuration/overview).

After you successfully deploy your router, it's ready to start receiving client operations! If you have any existing client applications that connect _directly_ to your GraphQL API, you can update their GraphQL endpoint URL to your _router's_ URL.

Similarly, any _new_ client applications should use your router's URL.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important considerations:**
>
> - For browser-based clients, make sure their origin is allowed in your router's CORS rules, which you can set in the router's [YAML configuration file](/router/configuration/cors).
> - Only update clients that communicate with the correct instance of your GraphQL API! For example, if your API has staging and production instances, only update clients that communicate with the instance used by this supergraph variant.

## Next steps

Nice work! We've registered two **subgraph schemas** with GraphOS, and we've set up a **router** that fetches its composed **supergraph schema** so it can execute operations across subgraphs.

If we now publish changes to one of our subgraph schemas, our running router _automatically_ fetches the corresponding changes to the supergraph schema (assuming composition succeeds).

Next, we'll cover some of the most common and important actions to perform on your new supergraph, including:

- Updating subgraph schemas
- Adding another subgraph
- Setting up schema checks
