title: The GraphOS Platform API
description: Automate GraphOS tasks in your own code
---

The **GraphOS Platform API** enables you to perform GraphOS actions from your own custom application. Currently, these actions include:

- Fetching details about your organization's graphs
- Publishing schemas to new or existing variants
- Running [schema checks](./delivery/schema-checks/) and obtaining their results
- Removing variants from a graph
- Removing subgraphs from a supergraph
- Managing API keys

We'll continue to expand the Platform API with additional GraphOS functionality over time.

## API docs

The Platform API is itself represented as a public graph in GraphOS! Documentation for the API (which includes a README and collections of example operations) is available in Apollo Studio.
