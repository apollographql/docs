<blockquote>

**Cloud supergraph support for GraphQL subscriptions is currently in [preview](/resources/product-launch-stages#preview).**

You can also use subscriptions with an Enterprise self-hosted supergraph. See the [Apollo Router documentation](/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/).

</blockquote>

Cloud supergraphs provide preview support for GraphQL subscription operations:

```graphql
subscription OnStockPricesChanged {
  stockPricesChanged {
    symbol
    price
  }
}
```

With a cloud supergraph, you can add `Subscription` fields to the schema of any subgraph that supports the [`graphql-transport-ws` WebSocket protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md):

```graphql title="stocks.graphql"
type Subscription {
  stockPricesChanged: [Stock!]!
}
```

Clients can then execute subscriptions on your cloud router, which executes them on your subgraphs.

> ⚠️ **Important:** To use subscriptions with your cloud supergraph, you must first complete certain [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## What are subscriptions for?

GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to receive continual, real-time updates whenever new data becomes available. Unlike queries and mutations, subscriptions are _long-lasting_. This means a client can receive multiple updates from a single subscription:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as GraphQL Client
    participant Router as Cloud Router
    Client->>Router: Initiates subscription
    Note over Router: New data available
    Router->>Client: Sends new data
    Note over Router: New data available
    Router->>Client: Sends new data
```

Subscriptions are best suited to apps that rely on frequently-changing, time-sensitive data (such as stock prices, IoT sensor readings, live chat, or sports scores).

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  client(Client);
  subgraph "<b>GraphOS</b>";
  router(["Cloud<br/>Router"]);
  end;
  subgraph "<b>Your infrastructure</b>";
  subgraphA[Stocks<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Portfolios<br/>subgraph];
  router-->|"Subscribes<br/>over WebSocket"|subgraphA;
  router-.->|Can query for<br/>entity fields<br/>as needed|subgraphB;
  end;
  client-->|Subscribes<br/>over HTTP|router;
  class client secondary;
```

1. A client executes a GraphQL subscription operation against your cloud router _over HTTP:_

    ```graphql title="Example subscription"
    subscription OnStockPricesChanged {
      stockPricesChanged {
        symbol
        price
      }
    }
    ```

   - **The client does _not_ use a WebSocket protocol!** Instead, it receives updates via [multipart HTTP responses](/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/).
   - By using HTTP for subscriptions, clients can execute _all_ GraphQL operation types over HTTP instead of using two different protocols.
   - Apollo Client for [Web](/react/data/subscriptions#http), [Kotlin](/kotlin/essentials/subscriptions#configuring-http-subscriptions), and [iOS](/ios/fetching/subscriptions#http) all support GraphQL subscriptions over HTTP with minimal configuration. See each library's documentation for details.

2. When your cloud router receives a subscription, it executes that _same_ subscription against whichever subgraph defines the requested field (`stockPricesChanged` in the example above).

   - This communication _does_ use a WebSocket subprotocol (specifically, [`graphql-transport-ws`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)).

3. The subgraph periodically sends new data to your router. Whenever it does, the router returns that data to the client in an additional HTTP response part.
   - A subscription can include federated entity fields that are defined in _other_ subgraphs. If it does, the router _first_ fetches those fields by querying the corresponding subgraphs (such as **Portfolios** in the diagram above). These queries use HTTP as usual.

## Prerequisites

⚠️ **Before you add `Subscription` fields to your subgraphs,** do _all_ of the following _in the order shown_ to prevent errors:

1. Make sure you've [created a cloud supergraph](../quickstart/cloud) and connected your GraphQL API to it!

2. [Update your supergraph's build pipeline](../graphs/updating#2-update-your-build-pipeline) to use Apollo Federation 2.4 or later.
    - Previous versions of Apollo Federation don't support subscription operations.
3. If your subgraph schemas specify an Apollo Federation version, modify them to use Apollo Federation 2.4 or later:
    ```graphql title="stocks.graphql"
    extend schema
    @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.4", #highlight-line
          import: ["@key", "@shareable"])

    type Subscription {
      stockPricesChanged: [Stock!]!
    }
    ```

    - You can _skip_ modifying subgraph schemas that don't define any `Subscription` fields.

4. In each subgraph with subscriptions, make sure the subgraph uses the [`graphql-transport-ws`](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) WebSocket protocol for subscriptions.

5. In each subgraph with subscriptions, make sure the subgraph hosts its subscriptions WebSocket endpoint at the path `/ws`.

    - If your WebSocket endpoint is currently hosted at a different path, you can add `/ws` as an _additional_ path instead of removing the original path. This is helpful if legacy clients will continue executing subscriptions on your subgraph directly using the original path.

6. Deploy your updated subgraphs.

After you complete these prerequisites, you begin [executing subscriptions](#example-execution) on your cloud router.

## Example execution

Let's say our supergraph includes the following subgraphs and partial schemas:

<CodeColumns>

```graphql title="Products subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  price: Int!
}

# highlight-start
type Subscription {
  productPriceChanged: Product!
}
#highlight-end
```

```graphql title="Reviews subgraph"
type Product @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review!]!
}

type Review {
  score: Int!
}
```

</CodeColumns>

A client can execute the following subscription against our router:

> ⚠️ **Remember, clients execute subscriptions against your router [over HTTP!](#how-it-works)**
>
> Apollo Client for [Web](/react/data/subscriptions#http), [Kotlin](/kotlin/essentials/subscriptions#configuring-http-subscriptions), and [iOS](/ios/fetching/subscriptions#http) all support HTTP-based subscriptions.

```graphql
subscription OnProductPriceChanged {
  productPriceChanged {
    # Defined in Products subgraph
    name
    price
    reviews {
      # Defined in Reviews subgraph!
      score
    }
  }
}
```

When our router receives this operation, it executes a corresponding subscription operation against the Products subgraph (over a new WebSocket connection):

```graphql
subscription {
  productPriceChanged {
    id # Added for entity fetching
    name
    price
    # Reviews fields removed!
  }
}
```

<blockquote>

**Note the following:**

- This operation _adds_ the `Product.id` field. The router needs `@key` fields of the `Product` entity to merge entity fields from across subgraphs.
- This operation _removes_ all fields defined in the Reviews subgraph, because the Products subgraph can't resolve them.

</blockquote>

At any point after the subscription is initiated, the Products subgraph might send updated data to our router. Whenever this happens, the router _does not_ immediately return this data to the client, because it's missing requested fields from the Reviews subgraph!

Instead, our router executes a standard GraphQL _query_ against the Reviews subgraph to fetch the missing entity fields:

```graphql
query {
  _entities(representations: [...]) {
    ... on Product {
      reviews {
        score
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After receiving this query result from the Reviews subgraph, our router combines it with the data from Products and returns the combination to the subscribing client.

## Trying subscriptions with `curl`

To quickly try out HTTP-based subscriptions _without_ setting up an Apollo Client library, you can execute a `curl` command against your cloud router with the following format:

```bash title="Example curl request" showLineNumbers=false
 curl 'https://main--my-org-supergraph.apollographos.net/graphql' -v \
  -H 'accept: multipart/mixed; boundary="graphql"; subscriptionSpec=1.0, application/json' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"subscription OnProductPriceChanged { productPriceChanged { name price reviews { score } } }","operationName":"OnProductPriceChanged"}'
```

This command creates an HTTP multipart request and keeps an open connection that receives new subscription data in multiple response parts:

```text showLineNumbers=false disableCopy=true
--graphql
content-type: application/json

{}
--graphql
content-type: application/json

{"payload":{"data":{"productPriceChanged":{"name":"Croissant","price":400,"reviews":[{"score":5}]}}}}
--graphql
content-type: application/json

{"payload":{"data":{"productPriceChanged":{"name":"Croissant","price":375,"reviews":[{"score":5}]}}}}
--graphql
content-type: application/json

{"payload":{"data":{"productPriceChanged":{"name":"Croissant","price":425,"reviews":[{"score":5}]}}}}
--graphql--
```

> This example subscription only emits three events and then directly closes the connection.
>
> For more information on this multipart HTTP subscription protocol, see [this article](/router/executing-operations/subscription-multipart-protocol/).
