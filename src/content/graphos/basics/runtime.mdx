subtitle: Learn about self-hosted and cloud graph runtime options
description: Apollo provides cloud and self-hosted graph runtime options. The runtime acts as an entry point to your GraphQL APIs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with.
---

With supergraph architecture (also known as [Apollo Federation](/federation/)), each component service is known as a _subgraph_. The GraphOS _Federation Runtime_ acts as an entry point to your subgraphs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with. Clients send operations to your runtime's public endpoint instead of directly to your APIs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  runtime(["Federation<br/>Runtime"]);
  subgraphA[Subgraph A];
  subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  runtime --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  clients -.- runtime;
  class clients secondary;
```

The runtime intelligently executes each incoming client operation across the appropriate combination of subgraphs. It then merges subgraph responses into a single response for the client. You can configure your runtime's error handling, CORS settings, other security features, and more. Your configuration options depend on your runtime type.

## GraphOS runtime types

With GraphOS, you can choose for Apollo to provision and manage a cloud-hosted runtime for you:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Apollo Cloud"
    runtime(["Federation<br/>Runtime"]);
  end;
  subgraph YourInfra["Your infrastructure"];
    subgraphA[Subgraph A];
    subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  end;
  clients -.- runtime;
  runtime --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  classDef padding padding-left:1em, padding-right:1em
  YourInfra:::padding
  class clients secondary;
```

Or you can choose to self-host your runtime:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  runtime(["Federation<br/>Runtime"]);
  serviceB[Subgraph A];
  serviceC[Subgraph B];
  runtime --- serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- runtime;
  class clients secondary;
```

Cloud and self-hosted runtimes are both powered by the Apollo Routerâ€”a high-performance runtime runtime packaged as a [standalone binary](https://github.com/apollographql/router).

### Runtime comparison

Apollo offers the following runtime options, in increasing order of configurability:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Runtime type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Configurability</th>
      <th>Plan availability</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Shared cloud runtime</th>
      <td>Apollo provisions and manages runtimes on shared infrastructure.</td>
      <td>

        Apollo provisions and manages runtimes on dedicated infrastructure that

### GraphOS runtime features

Although all GraphOS runtimes (both cloud- and self-hosted) are powered by the source-available Apollo Router binary, they offer an expanded feature set that isn't available when running the Apollo Router without connecting it to GraphOS.

Cloud-hosted runtimes automatically have access to additional GraphOS runtime features, while self-hosted runtimes must be authenticated with a GraphOS Enterprise license to gain access to these features. Refer to the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router) to compare GraphOS runtime features across plan types.

## Setup and configuration

For setup and configuration instructions, refer to the respective runtime documentation:

- [Cloud runtime on shared infrastructure](./quickstart/cloud)
- [Cloud runtime on dedicated infrastructure](/graphos/cloud-routing/dedicated/quickstart)
- [Self-hosted runtime](./quickstart/self-hosted)
