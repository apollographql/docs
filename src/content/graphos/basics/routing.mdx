title: Routing for supergraphs
subtitle: Learn about self-hosted and cloud routing options
description: Apollo provides cloud and self-hosted routing options. A router acts as an entry point to your GraphQL APIs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with.
---

With supergraph architecture (also known as [Apollo Federation](/federation/)), each component service is known as a **subgraph**. A **router** acts as an entry point to your subgraphs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with. Clients send operations to your router's public endpoint instead of directly to your APIs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Subgraph A];
  subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

The router intelligently executes each incoming client operation across the appropriate combination of subgraphs. It then merges subgraph responses into a single response for the client. You can configure your router's error handling, CORS settings, other security features, and more. Your configuration options depend on your router type.

## Router types

With GraphOS, you can host your own Apollo Router, a configurable, high-performance routing runtime packaged as a standalone binary:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  serviceB[Subgraph A];
  serviceC[Subgraph B];
  router --- serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

Or you can choose for Apollo to provision and manage a **cloud router** for you:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Apollo Cloud"
    router(["Router"]);
  end;
  subgraph YourInfra["Your infrastructure"];
    subgraphA[Subgraph A];
    subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  classDef padding padding-left:1em, padding-right:1em
  YourInfra:::padding
  class clients secondary;
```

Cloud routers use the same [Apollo Router binary](https://github.com/apollographql/router) that you can self-host.

If you use a cloud router, you can choose to run it on shared or dedicated infrastructure. Running it on dedicated infrastructure offers more configuration options. Continue reading for a more detailed comparison of your router options.

<Note>

Apollo also offers the [`@apollo/gateway`](/federation/v1/gateway/) library, but we recommend the Apollo Router over `@apollo/gateway` because it provides [significant performance and security improvements](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/). For more information about the differences and how to migrate, see the [migration guide](/router/migrating-from-gateway/).

### Router comparison

Apollo offers the following router options, in increasing order of configurability:

Somes organizations might need to use Cloud Dedicated or self-hosted routing instead of shared cloud routing for these reasons:

- **Compliance.** All of your supergraph's components must be hosted in a particular region to adhere to compliance requirements.
- **Performance.** You need to minimize latency between your router and subgraphs by enabling them to communicate _without_ traversing the public internet, for example by hosting all components in a VPC.
- **Customization.** You need to configure or customize your router's behavior beyond what's available on shared infrastructure.

With the exception of Apollo-managed routing, self-hosted supergraphs benefit from all of the same GraphOS features as cloud supergraphs: metrics reporting, schema checks, the Explorer, etc.
