title: Routing for supergraphs
subtitle: Learn about self-hosted and cloud routing options
description: Apollo provides cloud and self-hosted routing options. A router acts as an entry point to your GraphQL APIs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with.
---

With supergraph architecture (also known as [Apollo Federation](/federation/)), each component service is known as a _subgraph_. A _router_ acts as an entry point to your subgraphs and provides a unified interface for clients to interact with. Clients send operations to your router's public endpoint instead of directly to your APIs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Subgraph A];
  subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

The router intelligently executes each incoming client operation across the appropriate combination of subgraphs. It then merges subgraph responses into a single response for the client. You can configure your router's error handling, CORS settings, other security features, and more. Your configuration options depend on your router type.

## GraphOS router types

With GraphOS, you can you can choose for Apollo to provision and manage a cloud-hosted router for you:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Apollo Cloud"
    router(["Router"]);
  end;
  subgraph YourInfra["Your infrastructure"];
    subgraphA[Subgraph A];
    subgraphB[Subgraph B];
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  classDef padding padding-left:1em, padding-right:1em
  YourInfra:::padding
  class clients secondary;
```

Or you can choose to self-host your router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  serviceB[Subgraph A];
  serviceC[Subgraph B];
  router --- serviceB & serviceC;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

Cloud and self-hosted routers are both powered by the Apollo Routerâ€”a high-performance routing runtime packaged as a [standalone binary](https://github.com/apollographql/router).

<Note>

Apollo also offers the [`@apollo/gateway`](/federation/v1/gateway/) library, but we recommend the Apollo Router over `@apollo/gateway` because it provides [significant performance and security improvements](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/announcement/backend/apollo-router-our-graphql-federation-runtime-in-rust/). For more information about the differences and how to migrate, see the [migration guide](/router/migrating-from-gateway/).

### Router comparison

Apollo offers the following router options, in increasing order of configurability:

### GraphOS router features

Although all GraphOS routers (both cloud- and self-hosted) are powered by the source-available Apollo Router binary, they offer an expanded feature set that isn't available when running the Apollo Router without connecting it to GraphOS.

Cloud-hosted routers automatically have access to additional GraphOS router features, while self-hosted routers must be authenticated with a GraphOS Enterprise license to gain access to these features. Refer to the [pricing page](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing#graphos-router) to compare GraphOS router features across plan types.

## Setup and configuration

For setup and configuration instructions, refer to the respective router documentation:

- [Cloud router on shared infrastructure](./quickstart/cloud)
- [Cloud router on dedicated infrastructure](/graphos/cloud-routing/dedicated/quickstart)
- [Self-hosted router](./quickstart/self-hosted)
