title: Supergraph-specific Studio features
---

Apollo Studio provides tools to help multiple teams collaborate on a supergraph and its subgraphs.

## Supergraph variants

Each [variant](./#variants) of a Studio supergraph has its own subgraph schemas, supergraph schema, change history, and metrics.

Different variants of a supergraph can even have completely different sets of subgraphs:

```mermaid
graph BT;
  subgraph "Staging"
  router2(["Router"]);
  users2[Users];
  products2[Products];
  reviews2[Reviews];
  router2 --- users2 & products2 & reviews2;
  end

  subgraph "Production"
  router(["Router"]);
  users[Users];
  products[Products];
  router --- users & products;
  end
```

This helps you test out adding new subgraphs (or removing existing ones) in non-production environments.

When you [publish a subgraph's schema](../delivery/), you can specify which variant of the supergraph you're publishing that schema to.

### Adding a variant

You can add a new variant to your existing GraphOS supergraph in the following ways:

* [In Apollo Studio](#adding-a-variant-in-apollo-studio) (cloud supergraphs only)
* [Via the Rover CLI](#adding-a-variant-via-the-rover-cli)

#### Adding a variant in Apollo Studio

> This method of adding a variant is available only to cloud supergraphs. For other graph types, see [Adding a variant via the Rover CLI](#adding-a-variant-via-the-rover-cli)

1. Go to your supergraph's Settings page in Studio and navigate to **This Graph > Variants**:

    <img
      src="../../img/federated-graphs/variant-settings.jpg"
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Variant settings page in Studio"
    />

2. Click **Add a variant**. The following dialog appears:

    <img
      src="../../img/federated-graphs/add-variant-1.jpg"
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Step 1 for adding a variant in Studio"
      width="450"
    />

3. Provide a **Variant Name** and click **Continue**. The next step in the dialog appears:

    <img
      src="../../img/federated-graphs/add-variant-2.jpg"
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Step 2 for adding a variant in Studio"
      width="450"
    />

4. Provide your first subgraph's **Routing URL** (this is the URL that your new variant's router will use to communicate with the subgraph), along with a **Subgraph Name**.
    - Creating a new supergraph variant always requires also creating the first subgraph for that variant.

5. If Studio can't fetch your subgraph's schema automatically from the routing URL, click **Advanced options** to provide the schema another way (such as by pasting the schema directly or introspecting a locally running server).

6. Click **Add a new variant**. When the action completes, your new variant is listed on your organization's homepage in Studio.

#### Adding a variant via the Rover CLI

To add a new variant to your supergraph with Rover, you publish its first subgraph's schema! To do this, you use the exact same Rover command as [updating an _existing_ subgraph](../quickstart/next-steps/#update-a-subgraph-schema). The only difference is that you provide the name of the new variant to the command.

[Learn about publishing subgraph schemas.](../delivery/#subgraph-schemas)

## Managing subgraphs

After you create a [cloud supergraph](./#cloud-supergraphs) (or a new variant of one), you can view a list of its associated subgraphs from the variant's Subgraphs page:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  alt="List of subgraphs for a cloud supergraph in Studio"
  src="../../img/subgraph-list.jpg"
  width="600"
/>

The list includes each subgraph's name and routing URL, along with type and field counts for each subgraph's schema.

### Adding a new subgraph

You can add your new subgraph to your GraphOS supergraph in the following ways:

* [In Apollo Studio](#adding-a-subgraph-in-apollo-studio) (cloud supergraphs only)
* [Via the Rover CLI](#adding-a-subgraph-via-the-rover-cli)

#### Adding a subgraph in Apollo Studio

> This method of adding a subgraph is available only to cloud supergraphs. For other graph types, see [Adding a subgraph via the Rover CLI](#adding-a-subgraph-via-the-rover-cli)

1. Go to your variant's Subgraphs page in Studio:

    <img
      src="../../img/federated-graphs/subgraphs-page.jpg"
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Variant subgraphs page in Studio"
      width="550"
    />

2. Click **Add a subgraph**. The following dialog appears:

    <img
      src="../../img/federated-graphs/add-subgraph-dialog.jpg"
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Dialog for adding a subgraph in Studio"
      width="450"
    />

3. Provide your subgraph's **Routing URL** (this is the URL that your supergraph's router will use to communicate with the subgraph), along with a **Subgraph Name**.

4. If Studio can't fetch your subgraph's schema automatically from the routing URL, click **Advanced options** to provide the schema another way (such as by pasting the schema directly or introspecting a locally running server).

5. Click **Add Subgraph**. When the action completes, your new subgraph is listed on the Subgraphs page.

#### Adding a subgraph via the Rover CLI

To add a subgraph to your supergraph with Rover, you publish the subgraph's schema! To do this, you use the exact same Rover command as [updating an _existing_ subgraph](../quickstart/next-steps/#update-a-subgraph-schema). The only difference is that you provide the name of the _new_ subgraph to the command.

[Learn about publishing subgraph schemas.](../delivery/#subgraph-schemas)

### Modifying a subgraph

From your variant's Subgraphs page, you can modify an existing subgraph's routing URL:

1. Open the "◦◦◦" menu for the subgraph you want to modify:

    <img
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Menu for additional subgraph options in Studio"
      src="../../img/subgraph-menu.jpg"
      width="450"
    />

2. Click **Edit routing URL**.
3. In the dialog that appears, provide a new URL and click **Update**.
    - Your router automatically begins using the new URL to communicate with your subgraph.

If you need to make any _other_ modifications to an existing subgraph, use the Rover CLI. [Learn about `rover subgraph` commands.](/rover/commands/subgraphs)

### Deleting a subgraph

> ⚠️ **Deleting a subgraph is dangerous!** Read this section fully before deleting a subgraph.

You can delete an existing subgraph from a variant of your cloud supergraph. If you do:

1. The variant automatically attempts to compose an updated supergraph schema using the schemas from all _remaining_ subgraphs.

    - Studio displays the result of this attempt, and you can cancel the deletion if there are errors.

2. **If composition succeeds,** the variant's router automatically begins using the updated supergraph schema. This means clients can no longer query the router for fields that are defined only in the deleted subgraph.

    **If composition fails,** the router continues using its _existing_ supergraph schema. This means clients can _continue_ querying the router for fields from the deleted subgraph, _until_ the remaining subgraph schemas are updated to compose successfully.

#### ⚠️ Important considerations
- **Deleting a subgraph can break existing clients!** This action is equivalent to removing _all_ of the subgraph's types and fields from your supergraph (unless they're also defined in _another_ subgraph). If a client sends an operation that includes any of those types and fields, the router will _reject_ that operation.
    - To help you remove schema definitions safely, learn about [schema checks](../delivery/schema-checks/).

- Deleting a subgraph in Studio has no effect on your actual running subgraph instance. It only removes your router's _knowledge_ of that instance and its corresponding schema fields.

#### Steps to delete within Studio

1. Go to the Subgraphs page for the subgraph's corresponding variant.

2. Open the "◦◦◦" menu for the subgraph you want to delete:

    <img
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Menu for additional subgraph options in Studio"
      src="../../img/subgraph-menu.jpg"
      width="450"
    />

3. Click **Delete subgraph**. Studio attempts to compose a new supergraph schema that _doesn't_ include the subgraph you want to delete.

4. A confirmation dialog appears that displays any composition errors that occurred:

    <img
      class="screenshot"
      alt="Dialog for confirming deletion of a subgraph"
      src="../../img/delete-subgraph-dialog.jpg"
      width="500"
    />

    If you're _sure_ you want to delete the subgraph, enter its name and click **Delete subgraph**.


## Viewing a field's originating subgraph

The **Schema > Reference** page in Studio displays a table of your supergraph's types and fields. This table includes a **Subgraph** column, which lists the subgraphs that define each type and field:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/schema-reference-type-row-with-subgraph-column.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot of Schema Reference, closeup of type row showing subgraph column"
  width="736"
/>

Clicking the subgraph link for a type or field takes you to the line where it's defined in the corresponding subgraph schema:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/type-definition-in-subgraph-sdl.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot of Schema SDL, closeup of type definition in subgraph schema"
  width="700"
/>

If you're using [the `@contact` directive](#contact-info-for-subgraphs) to specify owner contact information for your subgraphs, hovering over a subgraph name displays its contact information, enabling you to follow up with the appropriate team:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/schema-reference-type-row-showing-subgraph-contact-directive-tooltip.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing subgraph contact tooltip in Schema Reference subgraph column"
  width="736"
/>

## Viewing subgraph SDL

The **Schema > SDL** page in Studio displays the raw SDL for each type of schema associated with your supergraph (API schema, supergraph schema, and subgraph schemas).

> [Learn about the different types of federated schemas.](/federation/federated-types/overview/)

From this page, you can:

- View metadata about the composed supergraph, along with metadata about each subgraph (such its endpoint URL and most recent schema registration date)
- Identify which subgraphs define any type or field in your API and share a link with team members
- Search for types and fields
- Download a copy of your subgraph's SDL for local development
- Filter out comments and deprecated fields for improved scanning

## Contact info for subgraphs

You can use the `@contact` directive to add your team's contact info to a subgraph schema. This info is displayed in Studio, which helps _other_ teams know who to contact for assistance with the subgraph:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/subgraph-contact-info-on-sdl-closeup.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing use of contact directive info as metadata in the Schema SDL view"
  width="424"
/>

The contact info includes a name (of a team or individual), along with an optional description and custom URL.

### Adding the `@contact` directive to your subgraph

To use the `@contact` directive in your subgraph schema, you first need to _define_ the directive in your schema. Add the following definition to each of your subgraph schemas:

```graphql title="schema.graphql"
directive @contact(
  "Contact title of the subgraph owner"
  name: String!
  "URL where the subgraph's owner can be reached"
  url: String
  "Other relevant notes can be included here; supports markdown links"
  description: String
) on SCHEMA
```

You can now apply the `@contact` directive to each subgraph schema's special `schema` object. If your schema doesn't already define this object, you can add it like so:

```graphql title="schema.graphql"
extend schema @contact(
  name: "Acephei Server Team",
  url: "https://myteam.slack.com/archives/teams-chat-room-url",
  description: "send urgent issues to [#oncall](https://yourteam.slack.com/archives/oncall)."
)
```


#### Supported `@contact` fields

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr class="required">
<td>

##### `name`

`String!`
</td>
<td>

**Required.** The name of the person, people, or team responsible for the subgraph.
</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>

##### `url`

`String`
</td>
<td>

The URL where the subgraph's owner can be reached. This might be the URL of a chat room or forum, or it could be an email address.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `description`

`String`
</td>
<td>

Provides any additional helpful details about working with this subgraph or contacting its owner.

This field supports Markdown-formatted links.
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

#### Known `@contact` limitations

- To provide the `@contact` directive to Apollo, you must publish your subgraph schemas by providing a local `.graphql` file as the `--schema` option of [`rover subgraph publish`](../delivery/).
  - If you provide an introspection result to the command instead, the `@contact` directive is **not** included in that result.

### Viewing contact info

After you publish a subgraph schema that includes the `@contact` directive, the contact information is included in the metadata shown in Studio's **Schema > SDL** tab:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/subgraph-contact-info-on-sdl-closeup.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing use of contact directive info as metadata in the Schema SDL view"
  width="424"
/>

In the **Schema > Reference** tab, you'll also see a contact card when you hover over the subgraph link of a type or field:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/schema-reference-contact-directive-tooltip-closeup.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing subgraph contact tooltip in Schema Reference subgraph column"
  width="388"
/>

## Schema tagging

In your subgraph schemas, you can use the `@tag` directive to tag a type or field with an arbitrary string value:

```graphql {4} title="products.graphql"
  type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  codename: String! @tag(name: "internal")
}
```

By default, these tags are _removed_ from the [API schema](/federation/federated-types/overview/#api-schema) that's generated as part of composition. This means that tag information _isn't visible_ to clients querying your supergraph.

If tag information _should_ be visible to clients (for example, to help document your API), you can enable this for a variant in Studio with the following steps:


1. Go to the **Settings** page for your variant in Apollo Studio. 
2. On the **General** tab, click **Edit Configuration**. The Update Build Configuration dialog appears.
3. If you have a Federation 1 supergraph, enable the toggle for the `@tag` directive under **Directives** (this step isn't necessary for Federation 2 supergraphs).
4. Under **Build Settings**, enable the toggle labeled **Show all uses of @tag directives to consumers in Schema Reference and Explorer**.
4. Click **Save**. 


After you make your `@tag` directives visible, you can view them inline with both the Schema and Explorer tabs in Studio.

In the **Schema > Reference** tab, tags are shown inline with each type and field:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/schema-reference-tag-passthrough.png"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing tag directive in Schema Reference"
  width="600"
/>

Tags are also visible in the Explorer's Documentation tab:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/federated-graphs/explorer-tag-passthrough.png"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing tag directive in Schema Reference"
  width="424"
/>


## Supergraph support in the Explorer

The [Apollo Studio Explorer](../explorer/) provides enhanced support for working with supergraphs:

- You can preview how your supergraph's router resolves data for an operation by inspecting the operation's [query plan](/federation/query-plans) in the Response pane.
- While you're building operations in the Explorer, you can see which subgraph each field of your operation originates in by enabling subgraph hints from the Explorer's Settings tab.

## Viewing composition errors

If a supergraph's most recent set of subgraph schemas failed to compose, a **BUILD FAILED** label is shown at the top of the supergraph's page in Studio:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/composition-failed.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing a supergraph with a failed composition state"
  width="500"
/>

You can click this label to view the errors that must be resolved before composition can succeed:

<img
  class="screenshot"
  src="../../img/composition-error.jpg"
  alt="Studio screenshot showing the composition error modal that is opened by clicking the build failed label"
  width="500"
/>
