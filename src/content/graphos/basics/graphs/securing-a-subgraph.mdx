title: Securing subgraphs
description: With GraphOS
---

To keep your supergraph secure, it's important that your individual subgraphs are [queried _only_ by your router](/federation/building-supergraphs/subgraphs-overview/#securing-your-subgraphs). That's because your subgraphs expose powerful fields that the router uses to execute operations across them. External clients should _not_ have access to these fields.

This article describes steps for securing your subgraphs when using a [cloud supergraph](/graphos/routing/cloud).

> As with all changes, we recommend first performing these steps for a _non-production_ variant of your supergraph.

## 1. Generate a shared secret

To restrict subgraph communication to _only_ your router, we recommend creating a separate **shared secret** for _each_ of your subgraphs. Whenever your router queries a subgraph, it includes that subgraph's corresponding secret in an HTTP header.

You can generate a random secret using a variety of tools. For example, most password managers provide this functionality.

Here are some shell commands that generate a suitably random secret if you have the corresponding tool installed:

- `openssl rand -base64 256`
- `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(256))"`
- `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(256).toString('base64'));"`

## 2. Add the secret to your router config

Your cloud supergraph's router needs to know the shared secret so it can include it in all requests to the corresponding subgraph. You add the secret in the **Cloud Routing** section of your graph variant's Settings page.

> For details, see [Managing secrets](/graphos/routing/cloud-configuration#managing-secrets).

After you define the secret, you can inject its value into your router's configuration as an environment variable, as shown below. We recommend setting the value in a header named `Router-Authorization` (and again, create a separate secret _for each subgraph_):

```yaml
headers:
  subgraphs:
    products:
      request:
        - insert:
          name: 'Router-Authorization'
          value: '${env.PRODUCTS_SUBGRAPH_SECRET}'
    users:
      request:
        - insert:
          name: 'Router-Authorization'
          value: '${env.USERS_SUBGRAPH_SECRET}'
```

## 3. Configure the subgraph to require the secret

The exact steps you take to require the shared secret in your subgraph depend on:

- The language and framework your subgraph uses
- The service you use to host your subgraph

Most cloud providers include a mechanism for saving secrets that are then made available to your application as environment variables. Your subgraph should read the secret from an environment variable and reject any incoming requests that _don't_ include that secret in the specified header.

> All subgraph templates [provided by the Rover CLI](/graphos/graphs/creating-a-subgraph#starting-from-a-template) include this functionality out of the box. To use it, set the value of the `ROUTER_SECRET` environment variable.
>
> If you have an existing subgraph that wasn't created from a template, you can check a similar template's source code for an example.

## 4. Test the configuration

After adding the shared secret to both your router _and_ subgraph, do the following to confirm that communication has been secured as intended:

1. Verify that your router _can_ still communicate with the subgraph by executing a test query against the router from the Explorer.
   - Make sure the query includes at least one field from the relevant subgraph!
2. Verify that other clients _can't_ communicate with the subgraph by executing a test query _against the subgraph directly_.
   - This query should fail with an authorization error.
