title: Creating a new subgraph
description: For your supergraph
---

This article helps you get started building a new subgraph that you can then add to your GraphOS supergraph.

- If you're building a new GraphQL API from scratch, we recommend [starting from a template](#starting-from-a-template)!
- If you already have a GraphQL API to use as a subgraph, see [Starting with an existing API](#starting-with-an-existing-api).

## Starting from a template

The fastest way to create a new subgraph is to start with one of the templates provided by the [Rover CLI](/rover/commands/template). The `rover template` command generates the skeleton of a new subgraph for you, so you can immediately begin defining your schema and implementing your resolvers.

<Tip>

If your installed version of Rover doesn't include the `template` command (or if you don't have Rover installed at all), [install the latest version.](/rover/getting-started/)

</Tip>

You start by running `rover template use`, providing it the ID of your chosen template. For example, the following command creates a new directory called `my-subgraph` that contains the boilerplate code for a subgraph written in TypeScript using the Apollo Server library:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
rover template use "my-subgraph" --template="subgraph-typescript-apollo-server"
```

<Tip>

To see the full list of available templates, see the [Rover template docs](/rover/commands/template)

</Tip>

After generating the boilerplate code, you can start filling in your business logic. The generated code includes example resolvers for `Query` and `Mutation`, along with some [entity types](/federation/entities/) to use as your starting point. All templates also come with example GitHub Actions workflows to help with [publishing your schema in CI/CD](../delivery/publishing-schemas/#publish-with-continuous-delivery).

When you're ready to add your new subgraph to your supergraph, [see below](#adding-to-your-supergraph).

## Starting with an existing API

If you have an existing GraphQL API that you want to use as a subgraph, confirm whether it uses a [subgraph-compatible library](/federation/building-supergraphs/supported-subgraphs).

- If it does, consult the library's documentation to determine how to enable its support for Apollo Federation.
- If it doesn't, [open an issue to let us know](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-federation-subgraph-compatibility/issues/new/choose) and we'll work with the library's maintainers to add support.

## Adding to your supergraph

When you're ready to add a new subgraph to your existing GraphOS supergraph, do the following:

1. Enable federation support in your subgraph library.
   - If you [built from a template](#starting-from-a-template), federation support is already enabled. Otherwise, consult the documentation for your chosen library.
2. [Check your schema](/federation/managed-federation/federated-schema-checks) against your existing supergraph and handle any conflicts.
3. Set up your CI/CD pipeline to perform checks and also [publish your subgraph schema](../delivery/publishing-schemas/#publish-subgraph-schemas).

After you publish your subgraph's schema for the first time, GraphOS recognizes it as part of your supergraph, and you can start querying for data from all your subgraphs!

<Caution>

Make sure you [secure your subgraph](./securing-a-subgraph) so that only GraphOS can query it.
