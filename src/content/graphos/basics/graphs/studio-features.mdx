title: Managing graphs in Apollo Studio
---

This article describes Apollo Studio features for all [graph types](./#graph-types). For features specific to supergraphs, see also [Supergraph-specific Studio features](./federated-graphs/).

## Creating graphs

**To create a cloud supergraph,** see the [GraphOS quickstart](../quickstart/cloud/).

**To create a _non_-cloud graph** (i.e., a self-hosted supergraph or a monograph), see [this section](./#creating-graphs).

## Viewing graph details

After selecting an organization in Apollo Studio, click on a particular graph variant to view its README, schema, data, and settings. All of a Studio organization's members can access the data and settings for every graph that belongs to that organization.

> Enterprise accounts can set [member roles](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) to configure fine-grained access for individual members of their organization.

### The README page

When a user opens one of your graph's variants in Apollo Studio, its **README page** is shown:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="GraphQL codeblock in README"
  src="../../img/readme-example.jpg"
  width="500"
/>

Like the typical homepage for a Git repository, this page displays a Markdown-based README that you can edit with any content you like.

> **Note:** Only organization members with the [**Org Admin**, **Graph Admin**, **Contributor**, or **Documenter** role](../org/members/) can edit a variant's README. If a variant is [protected](#protected-variants-enterprise-only), **Contributor**s _cannot_ edit its README.

**Each variant has its own README.** If you edit one variant's README, those edits are _not_ applied to other variants. Among other uses, this enables you to provide different information to external consumers in a [public variant](#public-variants).

#### Supported Markdown

The README supports all [basic Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#basic-syntax) and _most_ [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/#extended-syntax) (including tables, code blocks, and footnotes).

You can define a GraphQL code block with the following syntax:

    ```graphql
    query MyQuery {
      users {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ```

This renders the code block with buttons you can use to copy an operation or open it in the Explorer:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="GraphQL codeblock in README"
  src="../../img/readme-codeblock.jpg"
  width="300"
/>

#### README shortcodes

The README supports a set of shortcodes you can use to populate it with data that's specific to your variant, such as the graph's name and the variant's graph ref:

```md
# Overview of {{ graph.name }}

Graph ref: {{ graph.ref }}
```

For a list of all supported shortcodes, click **Graph shortcodes** in the bottom-left corner of the README editor.

### Exploring your schema

Apollo Studio provides helpful views for exploring your registered schema:

* [The Explorer](#the-explorer), which helps you build new operations against your graph
* [The Schema page](#the-schema-page), which enables you to filter your schema's type and field definitions (and also view your schema's raw SDL)

#### The Explorer

Apollo Studio provides a powerful **Explorer** IDE that helps you visualize your graph and run queries against it. It's available from your graph's Explorer tab in Studio.

> [Learn about the Explorer.](../explorer/)

#### The Schema page

The Schema page lists the different kinds of definitions in your schema (objects, scalars, etc.):

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema page list of type definitions in Studio"
  src="../../img/schema-page-list.jpg"
  width="300"
/>

Select a kind of definition to view a table of all corresponding types:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema page list of type definitions in Studio"
  src="../../img/schema-page-table.jpg"
/>

Each type definition in the table includes:

* The type's name
  * You can click the name to view additional details for the type (such as fields for an object, or possible types for a union).
* The type's description (if your schema includes one)
* Which subgraphs define the type (if you have a federated supergraph)
  * Users with the **Consumer** role can't view subgraph details.

##### Filtering your schema

The top of the Schema page provides a **Filter Schema** box you can use to find types and fields that match a set of filters:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema page filter box and dropdowns"
  src="../../img/schema-page-filters.jpg"
  width="600"
/>

> * Click the arrow button to the left of the filter box to show/hide the filter selection dropdowns.
> * Click the button to the right of the filter box to copy a shareable URL for your currently active set of filters (you can also copy your browser's address bar directly).

Any filters you set remain active as you move between definitions on the Schema page.

You can filter your schema definitions by type/field name (as shown above), along with any combination of the following:

<table class="field-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Filter</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>

<tr>
<td>

##### `subgraph`

</td>
<td>

Include results defined in any of the specified subgraphs.

Valid only for federated supergraphs.
</td>
<td>

`subgraph:products,reviews`

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `tag`

</td>
<td>

If your graph uses the `@tag` directive, include results that have a `@tag` with any of the specified names. If viewing a table of objects, also include objects with at least one _field_ that has a specified `@tag`.

If your graph doesn't use the `@tag` directive, this filter is not available.

</td>
<td>

`tag:internal,experimental`
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `directive`

</td>
<td>

Include results that have any of the specified directives applied. If viewing a table of objects, also include objects with at least one _field_ that has a specified directive.

</td>
<td>

`directive:deprecated,unused`
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `returnType`

</td>
<td>

Include results with any of the specified return types. If viewing a table of objects, include objects with at least one _field_ that has a specified return type.

This filter includes all fields that return a particular type, regardless of each field's nullability or whether it returns a list. For example, if you specify `returnType:Int`, the filter includes fields that return any of `Int`, `Int!`, or `[Int]`.

</td>
<td>

`returnType:Int,String`
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

##### `argument`

</td>
<td>

Include results that take a GraphQL argument with any of the the specified names. If viewing a table of objects, include objects with at least one _field_ that takes a specified argument.

</td>
<td>

`argument:offset,limit`
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

###### Filtering rules

* If you list multiple possible values in a single filter, those values use "OR" logic.
    * For example, if you filter by `subgraph:products,reviews` the result includes definitions from each subgraph.
* If you apply multiple types of filters, those filters use "AND" logic.
    * For example, if you filter by `subgraph:products` and `returnType:Int`, the result includes only definitions that fulfill _both_ criteria.
* Currently, it isn't possible to use "AND" logic for multiple filters of the _same_ type.
    * For example, it isn't possible to filter by `subgraph:products` "AND" `subgraph:reviews` to include only definitions that are present in _both_ subgraphs.

### Tracking schema changes

The Changelog page in Studio displays a timeline of changes made to your graph's schema:

<img
  src="../../img/changelog-page.jpg"
  className="screenshot"
  alt="Schema Changelog tab"
  width="450"
/>

**Only schema changes that you publish to Studio are included in this timeline**, which is one of the most important reasons to [include schema publishing in your continuous delivery pipeline](../delivery/#publishing-with-continuous-delivery).

## Managing access permissions

### Public variants

You can enable public access for individual variants of your graph. If you do, **anyone with that variant's public link** can view the following pages for that variant in Studio:

- Home
  - This shows the variant's README.
- Schema
- Explorer
  - You can also [embed the Explorer](../explorer/embed-explorer/) on your own webpage.

This enables consumers of your graph to learn about your graph's schema and any special usage information (such as authentication details) that you've documented in [the public variant's README](#the-readme-page). They can also run properly authenticated operations against your graph with the Explorer.

People outside your organization can't view any _other_ pages for a public variant (Fields, Operations, etc.), and they can never view _any_ pages for private variants. New variants always start as private.

#### Making a variant public

> Only organization members with the [**Org Admin** or **Graph Admin** role](../org/members/) can toggle a variant's public visibility.

1. Go to your variant's Settings page and open the **This Variant** tab.
2. Find the Public card and click **Change**:

   <img
     class="screenshot"
     src="../../img/toggle-public-protected-variant.png"
     alt="Toggle public variant in Studio"
     width="400"
   />

3. Toggle your selection and click **Save**.

You can toggle the switch back to **Off** to make the variant private again.

After you make a variant public, you can click the variant's **PUBLIC** label at the top of Apollo Studio to get its public link:

<img
  className="screenshot"
  src="../../img/public-variant-label.jpg"
  alt="Public variant label in Studio"
  width="400"
/>

### Protected variants (Enterprise only)

If you have an Enterprise plan, you can designate particular variants of a graph as **protected variants**. Making a variant protected specifically affects the ability of users with the [**Contributor** role](../org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) to make certain changes to the variant:

- **Contributor**s _cannot_ push schema updates to a protected variant.
- **Contributor**s _cannot_ manage Explorer-related settings for a protected variant, like setting its URL.
- Graph API Keys with the **Contributor** permission _cannot_ report usage metrics to your graph.

These are the only operations (other than creating new protected variants and creating new graphs) that can be performed by **Contributor**s and not by **Observer**s, so one way of thinking of protected variants are that they are variants where **Contributor**s are treated as **Observer**s.

**Graph Admin**s and **Org Admin**s can configure whether a variant is protected from the **This Variant** tab of the variant's Settings page.

### Internal graph visibility (Enterprise only)

> For _external_ graph visibility, see [Public variants](#public-variants).

By default, graphs are visible to all members of your organization. If you have an Enterprise plan, you can set a graph to instead be visible only to members you invite.

You can configure visibility and grant your organization's members explicit access to your graph from the Access tab of your graph's Settings page.

Note that **Org Admin**s can always see _all_ graphs in your organization.


## Dangerous actions

### Transferring graph ownership

You can transfer a graph to a different GraphOS organization you belong to
by visiting the graph's Settings page in Studio and changing the **graph owner**.

### Deleting a graph

> ⚠️ **Deleting a graph cannot be undone!**
>
> If you delete a cloud supergraph, all of its GraphOS-hosted routers are **deprovisioned**.

You can delete a graph from Studio by visiting its Settings page and clicking
**Delete Graph**.
