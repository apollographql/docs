Some organizations with advanced requirements need to host every part of their supergraph in their own infrastructure, _including_ the supergraph's router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  clients(Clients);
  subgraph "Your infrastructure";
  router(["Router"]);
  subgraphA[Locations<br/>subgraph];
  subgraphB[Reviews<br/>subgraph];
  router --- subgraphA & subgraphB;
  end;
  clients -.- router;
  class clients secondary;
```

A supergraph with this structure is called a [self-hosted supergraph](../graphs/#self-hosted-supergraphs). Here are some reasons why an enterprise organization might need to use self-hosted routing instead of [cloud routing](./cloud/) (where Apollo hosts your router for you):

- **Compliance.** All of your supergraph's components must be hosted in a particular region to adhere to compliance requirements.
- **Performance.** You need to minimize latency between your router and subgraphs by enabling them to communicate _without_ traversing the public internet (e.g., by hosting all components in a VPC).
- **Customization.** You need to configure your router's behavior beyond what's currently possible with [cloud routing](./cloud-configuration/).

With the exception of Apollo-managed routing, self-hosted supergraphs benefit from all of the same GraphOS features as cloud supergraphs (metrics reporting, schema checks, the Explorer, and so on).

## Creating a self-hosted supergraph

Organizations with any Apollo plan type can create self-hosted supergraphs to test out this functionality before moving to an Enterprise plan.

See the instructions for your organization's [plan type](../org/plans/):

> If you just created your organization as part of creating your account, it's on a **Serverless** plan type.

1. Go to your organization's **Graphs** tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/).

   - **If you see this dialog...**

     <img
       src="../../img/studio-welcome.jpg"
       className="screenshot"
       alt="Welcome message for new Studio orgs"
       width="350"
     />

     ...then click **Coming from Apollo Odyssey, or want to connect a self-managed router?**

   - **Otherwise,** find the following notice in the bottom-right corner of the page:

     <img
       src="../../img/classic-graph-flow.jpg"
       className="screenshot"
       alt="Link to classic graph flow"
       width="300"
     />

     Click **Head over to our classic graph flow**.

   In either case, Studio displays the following dialog for creating a graph:

   <img
     className="screenshot"
     src="../../img/graph-creation.jpg"
     width="350"
     style="margin-bottom: 20px;"
   />

2. Specify an organization and title for your graph.

3. Leave the **Graph Architecture** as **Supergraph (default)**.

4. Click **Next**. A dialog like the following appears:

   <img
     src="../../img/register-schema-dialog.jpg"
     className="screenshot"
     alt="Schema registration options"
     width="500"
   />

5. Leave the **Supergraph Pipeline Track** dropdown set to its default value.

Your graph has been created, and it appears in the **Classic Graphs** section of your **Graphs** tab.

     src="../../img/graph-creation.jpg"
     width="350"
     style="margin-bottom: 20px;"

6. Leave the **Supergraph Pipeline Track** dropdown set to its default value.

Your graph has been created.
