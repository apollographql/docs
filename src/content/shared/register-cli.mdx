1. If you haven't yet:

   - [Install the Rover CLI](/rover/getting-started/)
   - [Authenticate Rover](/rover/configuring/) with GraphOS Studio

2. Decide how you'll provide your server's schema to Rover. You can either:

   - Use a `.gql` or `.graphql` file saved on your local machine, or
   - Perform an introspection query on your running server to fetch the schema

3. Run the `rover graph publish` command, providing your schema in one of the ways shown:

   ```bash
   # Provide a local .graphql file path
   rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema ./schema.graphql

   # Provide an introspection result via stdin
   rover graph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover graph publish my-graph@my-variant --schema -
   ```

   As shown, the first positional argument you provide `rover graph publish` is a [graph ref](/rover/conventions/#graph-refs), a string that specifies a particular variant of a particular graph in Studio.
