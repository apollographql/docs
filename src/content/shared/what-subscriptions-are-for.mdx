GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to receive continual, real-time updates whenever new data becomes available. Unlike queries and mutations, subscriptions are long-lasting. That means a client can receive multiple updates from a single subscription:

    participant Client as GraphQL Client
    participant Router as GraphOS Router
    Client->>Router: Initiates subscription
    Note over Router: New data available
    Router->>Client: Sends new data
    Note over Router: New data available
    Router->>Client: Sends new data
```

Subscriptions are best suited to apps that rely on frequently changing, time-sensitive data such as stock prices, IoT sensor readings, live chat, or sports scores.
