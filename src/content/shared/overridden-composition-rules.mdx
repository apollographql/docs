#### `OVERRIDE_DIRECTIVE_CAN_BE_REMOVED`

Indicates a field with the @override directive no longer exists in a source subgraph, so the directive can be safely removed.

<hr/>

#### `OVERRIDDEN_FIELD_CAN_BE_REMOVED`

Indicates that a field has been overridden by another subgraph. You should consider removing the overriden field to avoid confusion.

<hr/>

#### `UNUSED_ENUM_TYPE`

Indicates that an enum type is defined in some subgraphs but is unused (no field/argument references it). All values from subgraphs defining that enum will be included in the supergraph.
