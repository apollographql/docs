We recommend you follow this order while implementing:

| Implementation Step | Required for PQs? | Required for APQs? |
| -----| ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1. Generate the operation manifest| ✅ | -- |
| 2. Publish the operation manifest to a PQL |✅ | -- |
| 3. Enable persisted queries on the client when it makes requests | ✅ | ✅ |

The rest of this article details these steps.

Persisted queries also require you to create and link a PQL, and to configure your router to receive persisted query requests. This document only describes the steps that need to be taken by the client to create a manifest of the client's operations and send persisted query requests. For more information on the other configuration aspects of persisted queries, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries).
