Custom webhooks require you to set up an HTTPS endpoint accessible via the public internet.
GraphOS sends webhook notifications to this endpoint as `POST` requests.
Notification details are provided as JSON in the request body, as described in the next section.

1. Specify a name for this notification channel in the **Channel Name** field. This name must be unique. No other notification channel in your graph, including Slack notification channels, can use it.
2. In the **Webhook URL** input, provide the URL of your HTTP(S) endpoint.
3. Click **Next** and complete any remaining steps in the dialog.
