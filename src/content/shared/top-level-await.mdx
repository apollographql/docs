<Note>

In the examples below, we use top-level [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) calls to start our server asynchronously. If you'd like to see how we set this up, check out the [Getting Started](/apollo-server/getting-started#step-2-install-dependencies) guide for details.
