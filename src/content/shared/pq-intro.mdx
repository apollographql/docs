With [GraphOS Enterprise](/graphos/enterprise/), you can enhance your supergraph's security by maintaining a _persisted query list_ (PQL) for your GraphOS Router. To create and update the PQL, first-party apps register trusted operations to the PQL at build time.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Apps["First-party apps"]
  direction LR
  webClient("Web client");
  androidClient("Android client");
  iosClient("iOS client");
  end
  pql[[Persisted<br/>Query List]];
  webClient --> pql
  androidClient -->|Register <br> trusted operations| pql
  iosClient --> pql
```

<Note>

Clients can register any kind of operation to a PQL, including queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

</Note>

At runtime, the router checks incoming requests against the PQL, which can act as operation safelist, depending on your [router configuration](#2-router-configuration).

```mermaid

subgraph Apps["First-party apps"]
  direction LR
  webClient("Web client");
  androidClient("Android client");
  iosClient("iOS client");
end
bad("Bad actor")
subgraph Supergraph["Supergraph"]
subgraph Router["GraphOS Router"]
direction TB
router(["Graph<br/>Router"]);
pql[[Persisted<br/>Query List]];
router <--> pql
end
subgraph Subgraphs
direction LR
api1(["Subgraph A"]);
api2(["Subgraph B"]);
api3(["Subgraph C"]);
end
end

```

Your router can use its persisted query list (PQL) to both protect your supergraph and speed up your clients' operations:

- When you enable _safelisting_, your router rejects any incoming operations not registered in its PQL.

- Client apps can execute an operation by providing its PQL-specified ID instead of the entire operation string.
  - Requesting by ID can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage for large operation strings.
  - Your router can require that clients provide operations by ID and reject full operation strings—even operation strings present in the PQL.
