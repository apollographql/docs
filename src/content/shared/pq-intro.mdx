With [GraphOS Enterprise](/graphos/enterprise/), you can enhance your supergraph's security by maintaining a **persisted query list** (**PQL**) for your supergraph's self-hosted router. The [Apollo Router](/router/) checks incoming requests against the PQL, a safelist of trusted operations made by your first-party apps.

  webClient("Web client");
  androidClient("Android client");
  iosClient("iOS client");
  end
    subgraph Router["Apollo Router"]
        direction TB
        router(["Graph<br/>Router"]);
        pql[[Persisted<br/>Query List]];
        router <--> pql
    end
  subgraph Supergraph
  direction LR
  api1(["GraphQL API"]);
  api2(["GraphQL API"]);
  api3(["GraphQL API"]);
  end

Your router can use its persisted query list (PQL) to both **protect your supergraph** and **speed up your clients' operations**:

- When you enable **safelisting**, your router _rejects_ any incoming operations not registered in its PQL.
- Client apps can execute an operation by providing its PQL-specified ID _instead of_ an entire operation string.
  - Querying by ID can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage for very large operation strings.
  - Your router can _require_ that clients provide operations by ID and _reject_ full operation strings (even operation strings present in the PQL).
