<Tip>

- **If you're setting up SSO for GraphOS for the first time**, Apollo highly recommends using [these instructions](#setup) rather than the legacy instructions. By doing so, you will avoid having to set up SSO again when the legacy method is deprecated.

- **If your organization's SSO was set up before April 2024**, according to the [legacy instructions](#legacy-setup), we recommend creating a new SSO configuration with the [updated instructions](#setup).
