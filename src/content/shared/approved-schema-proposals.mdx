Once a proposal receives the [minimum number of approvals](/graphos/delivery/schema-proposals/configuration#required-approvals), its status changes to **Approved**.

Revisions made to an approved proposal don't change the **Approved** status of the proposal.
To set the proposal's status to **Open for feedback** or another status, [manually change it](/graphos/delivery/schema-proposals/creation#change-proposal-status) from the proposal's overview page.

Once a proposal is approved, your team can begin implementing the approved changes.
