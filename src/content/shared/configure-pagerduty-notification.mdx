To set up PagerDuty alerts, you must:

1. Create a PagerDuty integration key.
2. Provide that integration key to GraphOS Studio.

#### 1. Create a PagerDuty integration key

Generate an [integration key](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#events-api-keys) for the service that should receive alerts in PagerDuty.
You can select an [existing service](#existing-services) that corresponds to your GraphQL API or [**Add New Service**](#adding-a-service).

##### Existing services

1. In PagerDuty, go to your existing service's **Integrations** tab and click **new integration**.
2. Enter an **Integration Name**, for example, `GraphOS Alerts`.
3. Under **Integration type**, choose **Use our API directly** and **Events API v2**.
4. Click **Add Integration**.
5. From the Integrations tab, copy the generated integration key from the table for use in the [next step](#2-provide-the-integration-key-to-studio).

##### Adding a service

1. In PagerDuty, under **Integration Settings**, choose **Use our API directly** and use **Events API v2**.
2. Enter an **Integration Name**, for example, `GraphOS Alerts`, and complete the add service flow.
3. From the **Integrations** tab, copy the generated integration key from the table for use in the [next step](#2-provide-the-integration-key-to-studio).

#### 2. Provide the integration key to Studio

1. In [GraphOS Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content), specify a name for this notification channel in the **Channel Name** field.

   - This name must be unique among your graph's notification channels.
   - This name does not have to match the name of the PagerDuty service, but it's recommended for simplicity.

2. In the **PagerDuty Integration Key** field, paste the integration key you obtained in [Create a PagerDuty integration key](#1-create-a-pagerduty-integration-key).

3. Click **Done**.
