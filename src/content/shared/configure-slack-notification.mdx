To set up Slack notifications, you first configure an incoming webhook in Slack, then provide that webhook's URL to GraphOS Studio.

#### 1. Create an incoming Slack hook

To create an incoming Slack hook:

1. From the [Incoming Hooks](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks) page of the Slack App Directory, sign in and click **Add to Slack**.
2. Select the Slack channel that should receive Studio notifications and click **Add Incoming WebHooks integration**.
3. Copy the **Webhook URL** (has the format `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`) for use in the [next step](#2-provide-the-slack-hook-to-studio).

You can repeat this process to create webhook URLs for different Slack channels.

#### 2. Provide the Slack hook to Studio

1. Back in GraphOS Studio, specify a name for this notification channel in the **Channel Name** field.

   - This name must be unique among your graph's notification channels.
   - This name does not have to match the name of the Slack channel, but it's recommended for simplicity.

2. In the **Slack Webhook URL** field, paste the webhook URL you obtained in [Create an incoming Slack hook](#1-create-an-incoming-slack-hook).
3. Click **Next**.
4. After you complete configuration, verify that your Slack channel receives a confirmation notification from Studio.

To configure multiple Slack channels, repeat this process with a different corresponding webhook URL each time.
