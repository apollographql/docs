Apollo supports two separate but related features called **automatic persisted queries** (APQs) and **persisted queries**.
With both features, clients can execute a GraphQL operation by sending an operation's ID instead of the entire operation string. An operation's ID is a hash of the full operation string. Querying by ID can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage for very large operation strings.
