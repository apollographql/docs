Apollo supports two separate but related features called _automatic persisted queries_ (APQs) and _persisted queries_.
With both features, clients can execute a GraphQL operation by sending an operation's ID instead of the entire operation string. An operation's ID is a hash of the full operation string. Querying by ID can significantly reduce latency and bandwidth usage for large operation strings.
