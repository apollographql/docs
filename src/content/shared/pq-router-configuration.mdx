As soon as a graph variant has a linked PQL, you can configure router instances to fetch and use the PQL by following these steps:

1. Ensure your router instances are ready to work with PQLs:

   - Make sure you're using version `1.32.0` or later of the Apollo Router. (The feature was released in [preview](/resources/product-launch-stages/#preview) in version `1.25.0` and made [generally available](/resources/product-launch-stages/#general-availability) in `1.32.0`.)
   - Make sure your router instances are [connected to your GraphOS Enterprise organization](/router/enterprise-features/#enabling-enterprise-features) and that they're associated with a variant that your PQL is linked to.

2. Set your desired security level in your router's YAML config file. For supported options, see [router security levels](#router-security-levels). When first implementing persisted queries, it's best to start with [audit—or "dry run"—mode](#audit-mode-dry-run).

3. Deploy your updated router instances to begin using your PQL.

Once your organization's PQL has registered all your clients' operations and you've ensured your client apps are only sending registered operations, you can update your router configuration to the [safelisting security level](#safelisting).
