  title="MERGED_NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS"
  whatItDoes="Checks if a non-[`repeatable`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-GAHnBRVABeBoB_2T) directive has been applied to the same schema element in different subgraphs with different arguments. [Learn more.](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/schema/directives/#in-subgraphs)"
  rationale="Arguments should be consistent across a non-[`repeatable`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-GAHnBRVABeBoB_2T) directive's usage. If arguments differ, it may be a sign that subgraph owners need to communicate about the directive's usage. If the arguments _need_ to differ, consider using a [`repeatable`](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-GAHnBRVABeBoB_2T) directive."

The following example violates the rule:

```graphql title="❌ Subgraph A" disableCopy=true showLineNumbers=false
type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String

type Query {

type Product {
  id: ID!
  name: String
}

type Query {
  products: [Product] @customDirective(orderBy: ["price"]) #highlight-line

```graphql title="✅ Subgraph A" disableCopy=true showLineNumbers=false

  title="NO_EXECUTABLE_DIRECTIVE_INTERSECTION"
  whatItDoes="Checks for executable directive definitions with no shared [locations](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#ExecutableDirectiveLocation) across subgraphs."

  whatItDoes="Checks that the source subgraph specified by [`@override`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#override) directive exists."
  rationale="The [`@override`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/federated-directives/#override) directive indicates that an object field is now resolved by a different subgraph. The directive can't work unless you specify an existing subgraph to resolve the field from."
