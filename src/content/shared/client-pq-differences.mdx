The persisted queries feature requires operations to be registered in a _persisted query list_ (PQL).
This allows the PQL to act as an operation safelist made by your first-party apps. As such, persisted queries is a security feature as much as a performance one.

With APQs, if the server can't find the operation ID the client provides, the server returns an error indicating that it needs the full operation string. If an Apollo client receives this error, it automatically retries the operation with the full operation string.

If you only want to improve request latency and bandwidth usage, APQ addresses your use case. If you also want to secure your supergraph with operation safelisting, you should register operations in a PQL.

For more details on differences between persisted queries and APQ, see the [GraphOS persisted queries documentation](/graphos/operations/persisted-queries#differences-from-automatic-persisted).
