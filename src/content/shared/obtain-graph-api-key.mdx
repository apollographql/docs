<ExpansionPanel title="How to obtain a graph API key">

<Caution>

API keys are secret credentials. Never share them outside your organization or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

</Caution>

1. Go to [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com/?referrer=docs-content) and click the graph you want to obtain an API key for.

2. If a **Publish your Schema** dialog appears, copy the protected value that appears after `APOLLO_KEY=` in the example code block (it begins with `service:`), and you're all set.

   Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

3. Open your graph's Settings page and select the API Keys tab. Click **Create New Key**. Give your key a name, such as `Production`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

   <Note>

   If you don't see the API Keys tab, you don't have sufficient permissions for your graph. Only organization members with the **Org Admin** or **Graph Admin** role can manage graph API keys. [Learn more about member roles.](/graphos/org/members/)

   </Note>

4. Copy the key's value. For security, you cannot view an API key's value in Studio after creating it.
