In a federated architecture, each of your graph's [subgraphs](/federation/subgraphs/) uses the Rover CLI to register its schema with Apollo:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  subgraph " "
  gateway([Gateway]);
  serviceA[Products subgraph];
  serviceB[Reviews subgraph];
  serviceC[Inventory subgraph];
  end
  registry{{Apollo Schema Registry}};
  gateway --- serviceA & serviceB & serviceC;
  serviceA & serviceB & serviceC -. rover subgraph publish  .-> registry;
  class registry secondary;
```

If you haven't yet:

- [Install the Rover CLI](/rover/getting-started/)
- [Authenticate Rover](/rover/configuring/) with GraphOS Studio

Then, do the following for each of your subgraphs:

1. Obtain the following values, which are required for the `rover subgraph publish` command:

   - The name that uniquely identifies the subgraph within your graph (for example, `products`).
     - If you've already registered a particular subgraph at least once, you can get its name from your graph's **Schema > SDL** tab in GraphOS Studio, or by running `rover subgraph list`.
     - Otherwise, you set the subgraph's name the first time you register it. Make sure the name is unique within your graph.
   - The URL that your gateway will use to communicate with the subgraph (for example, `http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/`).
   - The service's schema. The Rover CLI can either:
     - Use a `.gql` or `.graphql` file saved on your local machine, or
     - Perform an introspection query on the running service to fetch the schema

2. Run the `rover subgraph publish` command, providing your schema in one of the ways shown:

   ```bash showLineNumbers=false
   # Provide a local .graphql file path
   rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name products --routing-url http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/ --schema ./schema.graphql

   # Provide an introspection result via stdin
   rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4000 | rover subgraph publish my-graph@my-variant --name products --routing-url http://products-graphql.svc.cluster.local:4001/ --schema -
   ```

As you register your subgraph schemas, the schema registry attempts to compose their latest versions into a single supergraph schema. Whenever composition succeeds, your gateway can fetch the latest supergraph schema from the registry.

You can also fetch your latest supergraph schema with the `rover supergraph fetch` command, and it's available in GraphOS Studio from your graph's **Schema > SDL** tab.
