If team members could previously login before you implemented SSO, they must re-login to GraphOS Studio via SSO. Signing in creates a new user profile for them. Any personal API keys associated with their non-SSO user will be lost. Additionally, you must reassign any [GraphOS roles](/graphos/org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) previously associated with their non-SSO user profile.
